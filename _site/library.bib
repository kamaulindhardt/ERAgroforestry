abstract = {Meadows are regularly mown in order to provide fodder or litter for livestock and to prevent vegetation succession. However, the time of year at which meadows should be first mown in order to maximize biological diversity remains controversial and may vary with respect to context and focal taxa. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of delaying the first mowing date upon plants and invertebrates in European meadowlands.
Following a CEE protocol, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, JSTOR, Google and Google Scholar were searched. We recorded all studies that compared the species richness of plants, or the species richness or abundance of invertebrates, between grassland plots mown at a postponed date (treatment) vs plots mown earlier (control). In order to be included in the meta-analysis, compared plots had to be similar in all management respects, except the date of the first cut that was (mostly experimentally) manipulated. They were also to be located in the same meadow type. Meta-analyses applying Hedges'd statistic were performed.
Plant species richness responded differently to the date to which mowing was postponed. Delaying mowing from spring to summer had a positive effect, while delaying either from spring to fall, or from early summer to later in the season had a negative effect. Invertebrates were expected to show a strong response to delayed mowing due to their dependence on sward structure, but only species richness showed a clearly significant positive response. Invertebrate abundance was positively influenced in only a few studies.
The present meta-analysis shows that in general delaying the first mowing date in European meadowlands has either positive or neutral effects on plant and invertebrate biodiversity (except for plant species richness when delaying from spring to fall or from early summer to later). Overall, there was also strong between-study heterogeneity, pointing to other major confounding factors, the elucidation of which requires further field experiments with both larger sample sizes and a distinction between taxon-specific and meadow-type-specific responses.},

They also provide environmental and social benefits as part of farming livelihoods. Varied ecological and socio-economic conditions have given rise to specific forms of agroforestry in different parts of Africa. Policies that institutionally segregate forest from agriculture miss opportunities for synergy at landscape scale. More explicit inclusion of agroforestry and the integration of agriculture and forestry agendas in global initiatives on climate change adaptation and mitigation can increase their effectiveness. We identify research gaps and overarching research questions for the contributions in this special issue that may help shape current opinion in environmental sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Ensemble habitat suitability is calculated as the weighted average of suitabilities predicted by different algorithms. Advanced options for SDM in the current version (2.8–4) of the package include tuning the best combination of the number and weights of models contributing to the ensemble suitability and calculating the absence-presence threshold as the average or minimum of recommended threshold values. Algorithm-specific suitability values can be transformed via generalized linear models with probit link so that they become more similar in range. Other options include reducing spatial sorting bias by selecting background locations in circular neighbourhoods and generating suitability maps that show the number of contributing models that predict species presence.

abstract = {This paper proposes a processing chain for the derivation of global Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Fraction Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Canopy water content (CWC) maps from 15-years of MODIS data exploiting the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The retrieval chain is based on a hybrid method inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model (RTM) with Random forests (RF) regression. A major feature of this work is the implementation of a retrieval chain exploiting the GEE capabilities using global and climate data records (CDR) of both MODIS surface reflectance and LAI/FAPAR datasets allowing the global estimation of biophysical variables at unprecedented timeliness. We combine a massive global compilation of leaf trait measurements (TRY), which is the baseline for more realistic leaf parametrization for the considered RTM, with large amounts of remote sensing data ingested by GEE. Moreover, the proposed retrieval chain includes the estimation of both FVC and CWC, which are not operationally produced for the MODIS sensor. The derived global estimates are validated over the BELMANIP2.1 sites network by means of an inter-comparison with the MODIS LAI/FAPAR product available in GEE. Overall, the retrieval chain exhibits great consistency with the reference MODIS product (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.54 m2/m2 and ME = 0.03 m2/m2 in the case of LAI, and R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.09 and ME = 0.05 in the case of FAPAR). The analysis of the results by land cover type shows the lowest correlations between our retrievals and the MODIS reference estimates (R2 = 0.42 and R2 = 0.41 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) for evergreen broadleaf forests. These discrepancies could be attributed mainly to different product definitions according to the literature. The provided results proof that GEE is a suitable high performance processing tool for global biophysical variable retrieval for a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {In a 2-year experiment, the evergreen shrubs Erica tetralix and Calluna vulgaris (dominant on nu-trient-poor heathland soils) and the perennial deciduous grass Molinia caerulea (dominant on nutrient-rich heath-land soils) were grown in replacement series in a factorial combination of four competition types (no competition, only aboveground competition, only belowground com-petition, full competition) and two levels of nutrient supply (no nutrients and 10 g N+2 g P+10 g K m -2 yr-1). Both in the unfertilized and in the fertilized treat-ments Molinia allocated about twice as much biomass to its root system than did Erica and Calluna. In all three species the relative amount of biomass allocated to the roots was lower at high than at low nutrient supply. The relative decrease was larger for Molinia than for Erica and Calluna. In the fertilized monocultures biomass of all three species exceeded that in the unfertilized series. Molinia showed the greatest biomass increase. In the unfertilized series no effects of interspecific competition on the biomass of each species were observed in either of the competition treatments. In the fertilized mixtures where only belowground competition was possible Moli{\~{}} nia increased its biomass at the expense of both Erica and Calluna. When only aboveground competition was possi-ble no effects of interspecific competition on the biomass of the competing species were observed. However, in contrast with the evergreens, Molinia responded by posi-tioning its leaf layers relatively higher in the canopy. The effects of full competition were similar to those of only belowground competition, so in the fertilized series be-lowground competition determined the outcome of com-petition. The high competitive ability of Molinia at high nutrient supply can be attributed to the combination of (1) a high potential productivity, (2) a high percentage biomass allocation to the roots, (3) an extensive root system exploiting a large soil volume, and (4) plasticity in the spatial arrangement of leaf layers over its tall canopy. In the species under study the allocation patterns entailed no apparent trade-off between the abilities to offprint requests to: R. Aerts compete for above-and belowground resources. This study suggests that this trade-off can be overcome by: (1) plasticity in the spatial arrangement of leaf layers and roots, and (2) compensatory phenotypic and species-specific differences in specific leaf area and specific root length.},

abstract = {Acidic soils hamper maize (Zea mays L.) production, causing yield losses of up to 69{\%}. Low pH acidic soils can lead to aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), or iron (Fe) toxicities. Genetic variability for tolerance to low soil pH exists among maize genotypes, which can be exploited in developing high-yielding acid-tolerant maize genotypes. In this paper, we review some of the most recent applications of conventional and molecular breeding approaches for improving maize yield under acidic soils. The gaps in breeding maize for tolerance to low soil pH are highlighted and an emphasis is placed on promoting the adoption of the numerous existing acid soil-tolerant genotypes. While progress has been made in breeding for tolerance to Al toxicity, little has been done on Mn and Fe toxicities. More research inputs are therefore required in: (1) developing screening methods for tolerance to manganese and iron toxicities; (2) elucidating the mechanisms of maize tolerance to Mn and Fe toxicities; and, (3) identifying the quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for Mn and Fe tolerance in maize cultivars. There is also a need to raise farmers' and other stakeholders' awareness of the problem of Al, Mn, and Fe soil toxicities to improve the adoption rate of the available acid-tolerant maize genotypes. Maize breeders should work more closely with farmers at the early stages of the release process of a new variety to facilitate its adoption level. Researchers are encouraged to strengthen their collaboration and exchange low soil pH-tolerant maize germplasm.},

abstract = {Improved agronomic management is important to reduce yield gaps and enhance food security in sub-Saharan Africa. This study was undertaken to understand contributing factors to observed yield gaps for maize in farmer fields and to demonstrate appropriate agronomic survey methods. The study aimed to (1) demonstrate an approach for farm-level agronomic survey, (2) identify key crop production constraints and (3) define the nutrient input and output balances of different fields. Agronomic survey was conducted in 117 farmer fields randomly distributed in a 10 km by 10 km block in Babati, northern Tanzania. A semi-structured questionnaire and production measurements were used to collect data which were analyzed with regression classification and mixed effect models. The exploitable maize yield gap at farm-level reaches up to 7.4 t ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and only {\textless}5 {\%} of fields achieve maize grain yield of 5 t ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Slope, plant density, distance from homestead, crop variety, timing of planting and period since conversion significantly influenced maize yields. For example, fields on flat land had up to 1.6 t ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} more maize grain yield than those on steep slopes while fields with plant density {\textgreater}24,000 plants ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} had 900 kg ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} more yield than those with less density. At least 52 {\%} of the fields had negative nutrient balances. We conclude that cropping systems used in Babati should be preferentially supplemented with mineral fertilizers while optimizing plant density, increasing manure application and appropriate varietal choice in order to reduce the yield gaps.},

abstract = {Analysis of agricultural development potential at village level tends to neglect the factor of relative location, compared with the attention paid to physical resources and economic factors. This paper argues that, in African peasant agriculture, distance takes on increasing significance when farming populations are resettled and agglomerated, there being little intensification in evidence. The impacts of agglomeration and excessive 'journeys to work' are identified as affecting the quantity and the quality of agricultural labour inputs, the collection of domestic necessities (especially fuelwood), livestock husbandry, and socio-cultural and welfare conditions. Some simple analyses of time-distance relations, such as the 'effective working day', are also described, and a model of peasant decision-making with respect to optimizing farm activity location is proposed as a descriptive-explanatory tool. Response to distance problems is considered as part of rural change; and the particular position of peasant women vis-{\`{a}}-vis distance and transport technology is stressed. Data collection methods and descriptive statements of the spatial relationships within a village, or an agro-ecological zone, are outlined within the framework of rapid rural appraisal. Finally, a number of potential solutions to the agro-economic distance problem are briefly discussed-either as changes in farming systems, or as redistributions of the working population. Changes with the greatest potential are intensification and satellite settlements, though both face difficulties in policy and in implementation. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Agricultural landscapes are increasingly being managed with the aim of enhancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services and sustainability of production systems. However, agricultural management that maximizes provisioning ecosystem services can often reduce both regulating and maintenance services. We hypothesized that agroforestry reduces trade-offs between provisioning and regulating/maintenance services. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of studies carried out in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on crop yield (as an indicator of provisioning services), soil fertility, erosion control, and water regulation (as indicators of regulating/maintenance services). A total of 1106 observations were extracted from 126 peer-reviewed publications that fulfilled the selection criteria for meta-analysis of studies comparing agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices (hereafter control) in sub-Saharan Africa. Across ecological conditions, agroforestry significantly increased crop yield, total soil nitrogen, soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus compared to the control. Agroforestry practices also reduced runoff and soil loss and improved infiltration rates and soil moisture content. No significant differences were detected between the different ecological conditions, management regimes, and types of woody perennials for any of the ecosystem services. Main trade-offs included low available phosphorus and low soil moisture against higher crop yield. This is the first meta-analysis that shows that, on average, agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa increase crop yield while maintaining delivery of regulating/maintenance ecosystem services. We also demonstrate how woody perennials have been managed in agricultural landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services without sacrificing crop productivity. This is important in rural livelihoods where the range of ecosystem services conveys benefits in terms of food security and resilience to environmental shocks.},

abstract = {There is great untapped potential for farm mechanization to support rural development initiatives in low- and middle-income countries. As technology transfer of large machinery from high-income countries was ineffective during the 1980s and 90s, mechanization options were developed appropriate to resource poor farmers cultivating small and scattered plots. More recently, projects that aim to increase the adoption of farm machinery have tended to target service providers rather than individual farmers. This paper uses the Scaling Scan tool to assess three project case studies designed to scale different Mechanization Service Provider Models (MSPMs) in Mexico, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh. It provides a useful framework to assess the gap between international lessons learned on scaling captured in forty tactical questions over ten “scaling ingredients” as perceived by stakeholders involved in the projects, as well as private sector actors and government employees. Although at first sight the case studies seem to successfully reach high numbers of end users, the assessment exposes issues around the sustainable and transformative nature of the interventions. These are highly influenced by the design of the projects and by the environment and context of the intervention areas. Across the three case studies, large-scale adoption of the models was found to be hampered by lack of finance to set up MSPMs and insufficient collaboration among the value chain actors to strengthen and foster Mechanization Service Provider (MSP) entrepreneurs. Applying a scaling perspective on each case study project exposed important lessons on minimizing project dependencies. Positive examples include integration of capacity development materials in vocational training centers in Zimbabwe, promotion of MSPMs by other donors in East Africa and levering of nearly USD six million of private sector investment in appropriate machinery in Bangladesh. On the other hand, there is still a high dependency on the projects in terms of coaching of service providers, facilitating collaboration along the value chain, and provision of leadership and advocacy to address issues at governance level. These results have important implications for similar development interventions aimed at increasing smallholder access to mechanization services at scale and is to our knowledge the first cross-continental assessment of these issues to date.},

abstract = {Understanding the determinants of agricultural productivity requires accurate measurement of crop output and yield. In smallholder production systems across low- and middle-income countries, crop yields have traditionally been assessed based on farmer-reported production and land areas in household/farm surveys, occasionally by objective crop cuts for a sub-section of a farmer's plot, and rarely using full-plot harvests. In parallel, satellite data continue to improve in terms of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution needed to discern performance on smallholder plots. This study evaluates ground- and satellite-based approaches to estimating crop yields and yield responsiveness to inputs, using data on maize from Eastern Uganda. Using unique, simultaneous ground data on yields based on farmer reporting, sub-plot crop cutting, and full-plot harvests across hundreds of smallholder plots, we document large discrepancies among the ground-based measures, particularly among yields based on farmer-reporting versus sub-plot or full-plot crop cutting. Compared to yield measures based on either farmer-reporting or sub-plot crop cutting, satellite-based yield measures explain as much or more variation in yields based on (gold-standard) full-plot crop cuts. Further, estimates of the association between maize yield and various production factors (e.g., fertilizer, soil quality) are similar across crop cut- and satellite-based yield measures, with the use of the latter at times leading to more significant results due to larger sample sizes. Overall, the results suggest a substantial role for satellite-based yield estimation in measuring and understanding agricultural productivity in the developing world.},

Existing approaches to generate these recommendations lack scalability and predictivity in marginal production environments. We tested if crowdsourced citizen science can address this challenge, producing empirical data across geographic space that, in aggregate, can characterize varietal climatic responses. We present the results of 12,409 farmer-managed experimental plots of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Nicaragua, durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) in Ethiopia, and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in India. Farmers collaborated as citizen scientists, each ranking the performance of three varieties randomly assigned from a larger set. We show that the approach can register known specific effects of climate variation on varietal performance. The prediction of variety performance from seasonal climatic variables was generalizable across growing seasons. We show that these analyses can improve variety recommendations in four aspects: reduction of climate bias, incorporation of seasonal climate forecasts, risk analysis, and geographic extrapolation. Variety recommendations derived from the citizen science trials led to important differences with previous recommendations.},

However, little attention has been paid to the timing of these transformations. Here, we develop a temporal uncertainty framework using the CMIP5 ensemble to assess when and where cultivation of key crops in sub-Saharan Africa becomes unviable. We report potential transformational changes for all major crops during the twenty-first century, as climates shift and areas become unsuitable. For most crops, however, transformation is limited to small pockets ({\textless}15{\%} of area), and only for beans, maize and banana is transformation more widespread ({\^{a}} 1/430{\%} area for maize and banana, 60{\%} for beans). We envisage three overlapping adaptation phases to enable projected transformational changes: an incremental adaptation phase focused on improvements to crops and management, a preparatory phase that establishes appropriate policies and enabling environments, and a transformational adaptation phase in which farmers substitute crops, explore alternative livelihoods strategies, or relocate. To best align policies with production triggers for no-regret actions, monitoring capacities to track farming systems as well as climate are needed.},

abstract = {Across the developing world, the spread of mobile- and smartphones has led to a surge in mobile services for rural populations. While the potentials of mobile services to provide development opportunities for smallholder farmers are widely acknowledged, the potentials to use smartphone applications to collect data on smallholder farming systems are little explored. Yet, researchers studying farming systems need good quality data. So far, data on smallholder farming systems is typically collected using household surveys. Survey questions are prone to recall biases, however, which can be substantial. This paper assesses whether smartphone can be used to collect data in real time and thus increase the accuracy of socioeconomic and agronomic data collection. In this paper, we present a smartphone application that was developed for this purpose. We use the application to analyze the effects of agricultural mechanization on intra-household time-use and nutrition in rural Zambia. While the early, descriptive results shed interesting light on the effects of mechanization, the contribution of this study is primarily methodological. The study highlights the potentials of using smartphone applications to collect socioeconomic and agronomic data on smallholder-farming systems, potentially in real time. It also suggests ways to combine data recorded by respondents with built-in sensors of smartphones and external sensors and thus shows fascinating new pathways for researchers in the digital age.},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa recurrently face situations of complex and dynamic decision trade-offs. Short-term-oriented activities such as fertilizer application help to cover immediate food needs but compromise on future food production. Long-term-oriented production activities such as building up soil fertility are important systemic leverage points; however, they compromise on today's harvests. This article uses a semicomputerized observational experiment in Zambia to investigate farm management decision making with conflicting production objectives in a dynamic context. The results reveal that, overall, Zambian smallholder farmers have a strong and significant preference for short-term-oriented production activities, which leads to a suboptimal performance in production in the long term. A mind shift towards more long-term-oriented production activities is required to sustainably increase food production. Our findings point at two things in this regard: First, we identify decision rules that successful performers have applied and that should be the basis for capacity building strategies. Second, we indicate that our approach itself contributed to recognition of the importance of a longer term perspective.},

abstract = {Context: Land use and land cover (LULC) changes may affect the provision of ecosystem services. However, little is known how LULC changes influence the spatio-temporal variation in ecosystem service and their interactions along altitudinal gradients. Objectives: Here we assessed the spatio-temporal variation of eight ecosystem services in an altitudinal gradient between the year of 1986 and 2015, and quantified the effect of LULC transitions on the provision and interactions of ecosystems services. Methods: We modelled and mapped eight ecosystem services in an altitudinal gradient characterized by low ({\textless}600 m), middle (600–1200) and high altitudes ({\textgreater}1200) in Zona da Mata, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. We quantified changes in ecosystem services by contrasting ecosystem service maps between 1986 and 2015, and explored how four common LULC transitions affected the variation and the interactions between the eight ecosystem services. Results: The spatio-temporal analysis indicated that six out of eight ecosystem services increased from 1986 to 2015, while soil erosion control and water flow regulation decreased. In areas above 1200 m, regulating services dominated, while in areas below 1200 m provisioning service were most evidenced. LULC transitions from forest to agricultural areas, and vice versa, resulted in trade-offs between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Conclusions: LULC changes drive the spatio-temporal variation of ecosystem services along an altitudinal gradient with contrasting biophysical conditions. Future management of ecosystem services in the landscapes should take into the account the biophysical conditions and the consequences of specific LULC transitions.},

abstract = {This review focused on the efforts made to understand and manage Kenyan acid soils by use of inorganic, organic materials (OMs) and crop germplasms tolerant to soil aluminium (Al) toxicity and/or low soil available phosphorus (P). Kenyan acid soils which occupy 13{\%} of the total land area were developed through parent materials of acid origin, leaching of base cations and use of acid forming fertilizers. They are high in Al ({\textgreater}2 cmol Al/kg and {\textgreater} 20{\%} Al saturation) and low in soil available P ({\textless} 5 mg P/kg soil) due to moderate-high (107-402 mg P/kg) P sorption, hence crops recover only 9.6 to 13.5{\%} of the P fertilizer. Application of lime, P fertilizer and OMs increases soil pH, available P and reduces Al toxicity on Kenyan acid soils. Lime, P fertilizers and OMs have increased maize grain yield by 5-75, 18- 93 and 70-100{\%}, respectively on Kenyan acid soils. Similarly, deployment of crop cultivars tolerant to Al toxicity and/or low soil available P increases crop yields. However, lack of knowledge on the importance of lime, credit to purchase farm inputs, crop varieties tolerant to soil acidity constraints and inadequate amounts of OMs limits crop yield on Kenyan acid soils.},

This experiment examined mycorrhizal assessment, chemical and microbiological soil attributes in a maize-forage grasses intercropping compared to a maize-monocropping system. A complete randomized block design was used with crop systems installed under no-till management with three replicates, as follow: Maize (Zea mays L.); Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Aruana; Urochloa humidicola (Rendle.) Schweickerdt.; Maize-P. maximum intercropping and Maize-U. humidicola intercropping. In 2015/2016 season, intercropping maize with Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Aruana or Urochloa humidicola (Rendle.) Schweickerdt. promoted similar effects (Tukey test, p{\textless}0.05) to monocropped maize under no-till system on soil chemical and biochemical parameters related to carbon cycling in the soil surface layer, as well as the dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in tropical soils, managed for a period of more than six years. Similar grain yield was verified among maize crop systems. This result indicates that intercropping maize-tropical forage grasses represents an alternative for monocropped grains, a very common practice that is used in intensive management, being able to guarantee equivalent productivities and to combine grain production with crop-livestock systems. As a result, intercropping promotes the diversification of the property's income source, adding environmental gains, such as more efficient land use by cultivated plants, keeping soil constantly cultivated, storing carbon and contributing to minimize the impact of climate change on agricultural systems and the sustainability of food production.},

Building on a recent World Bank flagship report, this article introduces a concise framework for describing the main benefits from new information and communication technologies. They promote greater inclusion in the broader economy, raise efficiency by complementing other production factors, and foster innovation by dramatically reducing transaction costs. The article reviews the recent literature on corresponding technology impacts in the rural sector in developing countries. Digital technologies overcome information problems that hinder market access for many small-scale farmers, increase knowledge through new ways of providing extension services, and they provide novel ways for improving agricultural supply chain management. While there are many promising examples of positive impacts on rural livelihoods—or “digital dividends”—these have often not scaled up to the extent expected. The main reason is that technology can always only address some, but not all of the barriers faced by farmers in poorer countries.},

abstract = {Widespread implementation of conservation agriculture (CA) in North and South America and Australia suggests significant farmer profitability achieved through some combination of sustained or increased agronomic productivity and reduced input costs. Many believe similar agronomic benefits can accrue to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA) for a broad array of crops and farming systems despite marked differences in biophysical and socio-economic environments across these regions. Our objectives were to characterize (1) the quality of existing research including an assessment of the relevance of previously published reviews and surveys to SSA and SA, and (2) the empirical evidence from SSA and SA for agronomic benefits derived from implementing zero tillage (ZT) including the identification of knowledge gaps. Mulching and rotation were considered as associated practices within systems. Among surveys and reviews, most syntheses of multiple, independent studies were either entirely qualitative or used overly simplistic approaches to data aggregation. Few reviews used meta-analysis or other rigorous statistics that permit assessment of outcome sensitivity to influential observations; in general, review protocol descriptions were not sufficient to ensure transparency and appropriate handling of common biases. A search and screening of peer-reviewed literature identified empirical studies on conservation tillage in SSA and SA for maize (22), rice (16), cowpea (10) and sorghum (8). In attempting to extract data for an unbiased, systematic review of CA and maize, we found few studies fully reported critical data or meta-data; most common omissions were the univariate statistics required for study use in meta-analyses and critical supporting or explanatory data on soil type, prevailing weather, and management practices including handling of crop residues. In the short-term, ZT generally resulted in lower yields than with conventional tillage (CT). Occasionally these reductions could be linked to direct effects (e.g. increased soil compaction in rice), but failure to adapt other managements (e.g. weed control) to the CA system was a common and confounding indirect effect. Sufficient maize data existed to demonstrate that negative impacts on yield ameliorated with time in some cases accompanied by higher soil water infiltration and soil organic matter, particularly when mulch was added. However, the low number of studies, the missing supporting data and the large variation in treatments made it difficult to infer general direct effects due to mulching or rotation.Well-designed long-term experiments on CA featuring sound agronomic practice and comprehensive documentation are largely missing from the literature. Future systematic reviews addressing agronomic impacts of CA interventions will require appropriate handling of within and between study variance as well as sensitivity analyses and quantitative assessments of publication bias; on-going and future empirical studies must report a minimum dataset encompassing valid statistical measures and comprehensive intervention descriptions that enable standardization and systematic approaches in syntheses. We propose a minimum dataset that is generic to competent agronomy with measurements that are increasingly low-cost and easy to achieve and should therefore be routine in field experiments quantifying and explaining crop and cropping system performance. Until a larger number of field studies provide such quantifying and explanatory data from key crops and representative cropping systems, it is not possible to make strong general conclusions about benefits of CA and ZT on yields and resource use efficiency of smallholder farmers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, major innovation breakthroughs can trigger profound and disruptive changes, leading to simultaneous and interlinked reconfigurations of multiple parts of the global food system. The emergence of new technologies or social solutions, therefore, have very different impact profiles, with favourable consequences for some SDGs and unintended adverse side-effects for others. Stand-alone innovations seldom achieve positive outcomes over multiple sustainability dimensions. Instead, they should be embedded as part of systemic changes that facilitate the implementation of the SDGs. Emerging trade-offs need to be intentionally addressed to achieve true sustainability, particularly those involving social aspects like inequality in its many forms, social justice, and strong institutions, which remain challenging. Trade-offs with undesirable consequences are manageable through the development of well planned transition pathways, careful monitoring of key indicators, and through the implementation of transparent science targets at the local level.},

abstract = {Success in long-term agricultural production in resource-poor farming systems relies on the efficiency with which nutrients are conserved and recycled. Each transfer of nutrients across the farming system provides a risk of inefficiency, and how much is lost at each step depends on the type of farming system, its management practices and site conditions. The aim of this review was to identify critical steps where efficiency of nitrogen (N) cycling through livestock in smallholder crop-livestock farming systems could be increased, with special emphasis on Africa. Farming systems were conceptualised in four sub-systems through which nutrient transfer takes place: (1) livestock: animals partition dietary intake into growth and milk production, faeces and urine; (2) manure collection and handling: housing and management determine what proportion of the animal excreta may be collected; (3) manure storage: manure can be composted with or without addition of plant materials and (4) soil and crop conversion: a proportion of the N in organic materials applied to soil becomes available, part of which is taken up by plants, of which a further proportion is partitioned into grain N. An exhaustive literature review showed that partial efficiencies have been much more commonly calculated for the first and last steps than for manure handling and storage. Partial N cycling efficiencies were calculated for every sub-system as the ratio of nutrient output to nutrient input. Estimates of partial N cycling efficiency (NCE) for each sub-system ranged from 46 to 121{\%} (livestock), 6 to 99{\%} (manure handling), 30 to 87{\%} (manure storage) and 3 to 76{\%} (soil and crop conversion). Overall N cycling efficiency is the product of the partial efficiencies at each of the steps through which N passes. Direct application of plant materials to soil results in more efficient cycling of N, with fewer losses than from materials fed to livestock. However, livestock provide many other benefits highly valued by farmers, and animal manures can contain large amounts of available N, which increases the immediate crop response. Manures also can contribute to increase (or at least maintain) the soil organic C pool but more quantitative information is needed to assess the actual benefits. Making most efficient use of animal manures depends critically on improving manure handling and storage, and on synchrony of mineralisation with crop uptake. Measures to improve manure handling and storage are generally easier to design and implement than measures to improve crop recovery of N, and should receive much greater attention if overall system NCE is to be improved. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

While current approaches may effectively tackle some of them, they often fail to combine them together.The paper presents the integrative agent-centred (IAC) framework, which aims at filling this gap. It functions in accordance with these three pillars and provides a conceptual structure to understand farmers' behaviour in agricultural systems.The IAC framework is agent-centred and supports the understanding of farmers' behavior consistently with the perspective of agricultural systems as complex social-ecological systems. It combines different behavioural drivers, bridges between micro and macro levels, and depicts a potentially varied model of human agency.The use of the framework in practice is illustrated through two studies on pesticide use among smallholders in Colombia.The examples show how the framework can be implemented to derive policy implications to foster a transition towards more sustainable agricultural practices.The paper finally suggests that the framework can support different research designs for the study of agents' behaviour in agricultural and social-ecological systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Soil chemical changes, maize grain yield and nutrient recovery were determined. Lime and P-fertilizer significantly affected only the top-soil pH, Ca, Mg and available P, while the effects of N-fertilizer were evident on both top- and sub-soil N likely due to its faster mobility than P and lime. Grain P-fertilizer recovery efficiencies were 14 and 16-27{\%} due to 13 kg P and 13 kg P + 0.77-1.55 tons lime ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively.

abstract = {Recommendations and decisions of crop management in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are often based on traditional field experimentation. This usually ignores the variability of production factors in space and time, and hence invalidates such decisions and recommendations outside of the experimental sites. Yet, the use of alternative or complementary decision support approaches such as crop modelling is limited. In this paper, we reviewed the state of the use of crop modelling in informing site specific fertilizer recommendations in some countries in SSA. Even though nitrogen fertilizer recommendations in most countries across Africa are blanket, the limited employment of models show that optimum nitrogen application should be differentiated according to soil types, management and climate. A number of studies reported on increased fertilizer use efficiency and reduced crop production risks with the use of decision support tools (DST). The review also showed that the gross limitation of the use of models as agricultural decision-making tools in SSA could be attributed to factors such as low capacity due to limited training opportunities, and the general lack of support from national governments for model development and application for policy formulation. Proposals identified to overcome these limitations include (1) introduction of the science of DST in the curricula at the tertiary level, (2) encouragement and support for the adoption of model use by governmental and non-governmental organizations as additional tools for decision making and (3) simplifying DSTs to facilitate their use by non-scientific audience to scale uptake and use for farm management.},

abstract = {Managing climate-related risks is one of the key components of enhancing agricultural resilience and productivity under increasingly variable and changing climate. In this study, a decision support tool, SIMAGRI, was developed to translate climate information into agricultural and economic terms that can support strategic and tactical decisions in crop production e.g., crop choices, agricultural management practices, insurance needs, among others. The SIMAGRI helps users to run crop simulation models for three target crops (maize, soybean and wheat) with representative management options, based on historical climate data and probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts. The user-friendly interface of SIMAGRI allows users to compare results of several management practices (e.g., planting dates, crops and cultivars, fertilizer/irrigation application, etc.) given a climate condition, and thus help identify appropriate mixes of production options, which can increase (reduce) positive (negative) impacts of current and future climatic conditions. The SIMAGRI can be used for different purposes (e.g., initial assessment or operational use for generating crop yield outlook, etc.). It can enhance better communications with stakeholders, and for identifying their needs.},

abstract = {In the three major maize producing countries in the East African region of Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, up to 44{\%} of the dietary calorie requirements is provided by maize. It is also recognized that livestock are an essential asset of poor farmers in the mixed crop-livestock systems in this region. One of the major constraints to their productivity is, however, feed availability. A significant proportion of this feed is sourced from maize stover. We engaged in a multi-disciplinary research of dual-purpose maize cultivars with the purpose of contributing to smallholder food security. The specific objective of our endeavor is to better match new maize cultivars to farmers' needs by including fodder traits in maize improvement programs in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. We explored a novel approach for targeting maize breeding research. Agricultural development strategies must recognize heterogeneity in bio-physical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional and environmental factors when devising interventions and investments. The research effort into maize as a food and feed resource was, therefore, carried out in a cross-section of bio-physically and socio-economically contrasting areas across the three study countries. To this effect the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre's traditional targeting framework, maize mega-environments (MMEs), was combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based approach provided a spatial framework for the structured exploration of opportunities to transfer knowledge and technologies. Results show that maize is potentially an important feed resource in areas with high feed demand. Throughout the different MMEs, a range of different incentives for dual-purpose varieties can be found. The maps with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize will facilitate better targeting of new maize cultivars. Cultivars with good quality stover can now be preferentially promoted in areas with high demand for stover as feed, while at the same time matched to the bio-physically most suitable mega-environment. This integrated approach is widely applicable and will help increase the impacts from agricultural research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and aims To improve vegetable crops adapted to low input and variable resource availability, better understanding is needed of root system functioning, including nitrogen and water capture. Methods This study quantified shoot and root development and patterns of water and nitrate capture of two lettuce cultivars subjected to temporary drought at two development stages (Trial 1) or to continuous, localized drought and/or nitrate shortage (Trial 2). Results In Trial 1, early drought slowed down shoot and root growth, whereas late drought enhanced root proliferation in the top 0.1 m. Nitrate capture during drought was sustained by increased nitrate inflow from deeper layers. Plants did not recover fully from drought after re-watering. In Trial 2, root proliferation was stimulated in the drier soil compartment partially compensating reduced water availability and nitrate mobility. Under nitrate shortage, root proliferation was enhanced in the compartment where nitrate was more abundant, irrespective of water availability. Conclusions Changes observed in the root system are ‘feed-forward' mechanisms to sustain resource capture in a limiting growing environment. The type of stress (drought or nitrate shortage) affects coping strategies; nitrate concentration in the soil solution, combined with the nutritional status of the plant will determine the stress response.},

In this paper, we assess information efficiency along the knowledge transmission chain from researchers to agricultural extension agents (EAs) to lead farmers (LFs) to other farmers. By asking the same set of questions about a fairly well known technology, pit planting, we construct a measure of knowledge at each node of the knowledge transmission chain. Evidence shows that the majority of information loss happens at the researcher-to-EA link and the EA-to-LF link, and that the loss is potentially caused by teaching failures or by selective attention and learning among both the EAs and the LFs concerning all important details of the technology. Results highlight the need for greater emphasis during training and learning on key dimensions of technology packages that are commonly ignored.},

abstract = {The 'push-pull' technology is a novel pest management strategy developed for control of stemborers and striga weed, Striga hermonthica, in maize-based farming systems in eastern Africa, where maize is intercropped with desmodium, a forage legume, and Napier grass is planted as a border crop. Desmodium repels stemborer moths while Napier grass attracts them. Desmodium also suppresses the parasitic striga weed through a series of mechanisms ranging from shading to allelopathy through the root system. The technology is currently being disseminated among smallholder farmers in eastern Africa and adoption rates are rising. Our on-station studies have reported efficacy of this technology against the two pests resulting in increased grain yields. The current study was conducted between 2003 and 2006 in 14 districts in western Kenya to assess effectiveness of the technology under farmers' own conditions. Twenty farmers from each district, who had adopted the technology, were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a 'push-pull' and a maize monocrop. Seasonal data were collected on percentage of maize plants damaged by stemborers, the number of emerged striga, plant height and grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions on the benefits of the technology were assessed using a structured questionnaire. Stemborer damage and striga counts to maize plants were significantly lower in the 'push-pull' plots than in the maize monocrop plots. Similarly, maize plant height and grain yields were significantly higher in the former. Farmers rated the 'push-pull' technology significantly superior in having reduced stemborers and striga infestation rates and increased soil fertility and grain yields. These results demonstrate that the technology is equally effective in controlling both pests with concomitant yield increases under farmers' conditions in the districts studied. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Agricultural landscapes are increasingly being managed with the aim of enhancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services and sustainability of production systems. However, agricultural management that maximizes provisioning ecosystem services can often reduce both regulating and maintenance services. We hypothesized that agroforestry reduces trade-offs between provisioning and regulating/maintenance services. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of studies carried out in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on crop yield (as an indicator of provisioning services), soil fertility, erosion control, and water regulation (as indicators of regulating/maintenance services). A total of 1106 observations were extracted from 126 peer-reviewed publications that fulfilled the selection criteria for meta-analysis of studies comparing agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices (hereafter control) in sub-Saharan Africa. Across ecological conditions, agroforestry significantly increased crop yield, total soil nitrogen, soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus compared to the control. Agroforestry practices also reduced runoff and soil loss and improved infiltration rates and soil moisture content. No significant differences were detected between the different ecological conditions, management regimes, and types of woody perennials for any of the ecosystem services. Main trade-offs included low available phosphorus and low soil moisture against higher crop yield. This is the first meta-analysis that shows that, on average, agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa increase crop yield while maintaining delivery of regulating/maintenance ecosystem services. We also demonstrate how woody perennials have been managed in agricultural landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services without sacrificing crop productivity. This is important in rural livelihoods where the range of ecosystem services conveys benefits in terms of food security and resilience to environmental shocks.},

We compared households belonging to 432 pre-existing farmer groups operating in 60 program villages and 61 matched comparison villages. To address potential self-selection bias, we used program targeting as an instrument for program participation, combined with the difference-in-differences approach to control for time-invariant differences between our treatment and comparison groups. We complemented the above with semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of 40 purposively selected program participants. Despite evidence of variable program exposure and agroforestry uptake, we found modest, yet statistically significant, effects of Vi Agroforestry's program on intermediate outcomes, such as agroforestry product income, fuelwood access, and milk yields among dairy farmers. We also found that this program modestly increased asset holdings, particularly among households represented by female program participants.},

Consequently, the prospects of achieving sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems need to be examined vis-{\`{a}}-vis the dominant farmer typologies, so as to help craft effective and tailored interventions. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology to establish farm typologies prevalent within the smallholder farming systems and infer their implications for the drive to achieve sustainable intensification of agriculture. A cross-sectional survey was carried out, covering 600 households in four regions of Ethiopia's Highlands. Multivariate statistical techniques of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were used to group farmers into four distinct clusters. The study then compared relative levels of agricultural intensification and sustainability across the different typology clusters. The study found that households who are more commercially oriented and have larger landholdings, higher levels of productive assets and livestock ownership, exhibit higher levels of both agricultural intensification and relative sustainability. The study concludes that the farm typology approach has important policy application as it helps identify the set of socioeconomic characteristics of farmers that influence their propensity to achieve sustainable intensification.},

Yield advantages of more diverse crop rotations and their synergistic effects with reduced tillage are well documented, but few studies have quantified the impact of thesemanagement practices on yields and their stability when soil moisture is limiting or in excess. Using yield and weather data obtained from a 31-year long term rotation and tillage trial in Ontario, we tested whether crop rotation diversity is associated with greater yield stability when abnormal weather conditions occur. We used parametric and non-parametric approaches to quantify the impact of rotation diversity (monocrop, 2-crops, 3- crops without or with one or two legume cover crops) and tillage (conventional or reduced tillage) on yield probabilities and the benefits of crop diversity under different soil moisture and temperature scenarios. Although the magnitude of rotation benefits varied with crops, weather patterns and tillage, yield stability significantly increased when corn and soybean were integrated into more diverse rotations. Introducing small grains into short corn-soybean rotation was enough to provide substantial benefits on long-term soybean yields and their stability while the effects on corn weremostly associated with the temporal niche provided by small grains for underseeded red clover or alfalfa. Crop diversification strategies increased the probability of harnessing favorable growing conditions while decreasing the risk of crop failure. In hot and dry years, diversification of corn-soybean rotations and reduced tillage increased yield by 7{\%} and 22{\%}for corn and soybean respectively. Given the additional advantages associated with cropping system diversification, such a strategy provides a more comprehensive approach to lowering yield variability and improving the resilience of cropping systems tomultiple environmental stresses. This could help to sustain future yield levels in challenging production environments.},

abstract = {In the absence of mineral fertiliser, animal manure may be the only nutrient resource available to smallholder farmers in Africa, and manure is often the main input of C to the soil when crop residues are removed from the fields. Assessments of C and nutrient balances and cycling within agroecosystems or of greenhouse gas emissions often assume average C and nutrient mass fractions in manure, disregarding the impact that manure storage may have on C and nutrient losses from the system. To quantify such losses, in order to refine our models of C and nutrient cycling in smallholder (crop-livestock) farming systems, an experiment was conducted reproducing farmers' practices: heaps vs. pits of a mix of cattle manure and maize stover (2:3 v/v) stored in the open air during 6 months. Heaps stored under a simple roof were also evaluated as an affordable improvement of the storage conditions. The results were used to derive empirical models and graphs for the estimation of C and nutrient losses. Heaps and pits were turned every month, weighed, and sampled to determine organic matter, total and mineral N, P and K mass fractions. Soils beneath heaps/pits were sampled to measure mineral N to a depth of 1 m, and leaching tube tests in the laboratory were used to estimate P leaching from manure. After 6 months, ca. 70{\%} remained of the initial dry mass of manure stored in pits, but only half of or less of the manure stored in heaps. The stored manure lost 45{\%} of its C in the open air and 69{\%} under roof. The efficiencies of nutrient retention during storage varied between 24-38{\%} for total N, 34-38{\%} for P and 18-34{\%} for K, with the heaps under a roof having greater efficiencies of retention of N and K. Laboratory tests indicated that up to 25{\%} of the P contained in fresh manure could be lost by leaching. Results suggest that reducing the period of storage by, for example, more frequent application and incorporation of manure into the soil may have a larger impact on retaining C and nutrient within the farm system than improving storage conditions. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2009.},

The scope, content, and approaches of soil and soil fertility management research have changed over the past decades in response to lessons learnt and internal and external drivers and this paper uses IITA as a case study to document and analyse the consequences of strategic decisions taken on technology development, validation, and ultimately uptake by smallholder farmers in SSA. After an initial section describing the external environment within which soil and soil fertility management research is operating, various dimensions of this research area are covered: (i) ‘strategic research', ‘Research for Development', partnerships, and balancing acts, (ii) changing role of characterization due to the expansion in geographical scope and shift from soils to farms and livelihoods, (iii) technology development: changes in vision, content, and scale of intervention, (iv) technology validation and delivery to farming communities, and (v) impact and feedback to the technology development and validation process. Each of the above sections follows a chronological approach, covering the last five decades (from the late 1960s till today). The paper ends with a number of lessons learnt which could be considered for future initiatives aiming at developing and delivering improved soil and soil fertility management practices to smallholder farming communities in SSA.},

abstract = {This thesis explores the potential of using herbaceous and grain legume species to improve soil fertility and farm productivity in the heterogeneous smallholder farming systems of western Kenya. Poor soil fertility is responsible for the limited productivity of the western Kenya smallholder farming systems. Although legumes have the potential for improving productivity, their sustainable use is impeded by the high degree of biophysical and socio-economic heterogeneity that characterizes the farming systems. The socio-ecological niche concept was proposed as a framework for facilitating the identification and integrated assessment of biophysical and socio- economic factors with potential influence on the choice of sustainable legume technologies for smallholder farmers. The utility of the socio-ecological niche concept was tested through on-farm experiments and socio-economic surveys in western Kenya. The on-farm experiments were conducted across three major agro-ecological zones (AEZ), and under different soil fertility conditions, to assess legume emergence, survival, nodulation, diseases tolerance, grain yield, biomass production, atmospheric N2-fixation and net N contribution to soil N fertility. In addition, the economic benefits of growing grain and green manure legumes in rotation with maize were assessed to determine how they are influenced by agro-ecological conditions and within farm soil fertility heterogeneity. Socio-economic surveys characterized farmer legume production objectives, as well as socio-cultural, economic and institutional factors with potential impact on the use of legume technologies by western Kenya smallholder farmers. The biophysical and socio-economic factors were integrated and analysed to identify legume species for different farmer resource endowment groups, agro-ecological conditions and field typologies. Analysis of the alternative legume production scenario was undertaken, to test the utility of the socio-ecological niche concept. Legume grain yield, total dry matter production (TDM) and atmospheric N2- fixation increased with rainfall and soil fertility status. TDM ranged from 0.1 Mg ha-1 to 13.9 Mg ha-1, and was generally less for the grain legumes, compared with the green manure and forage legumes. However, soyabean and groundnut showed greater potential among the grain legumes, producing up to 4.6 Mg ha-1 TDM. While the legume species and varieties showed capacity to form viable nodules with naturally occurring rhizobia, application of P was essential for good nodulation. Generally, the species fixed 23-90{\%} of their N requirements in AEZ 1 (Museno) and AEZ 2 (Majengo), compared to 7-77{\%} of their N requirements in AEZ 3 (Ndori). However, N2-fixation by the green manure species (29-232 kg N ha-1) was greater than that by grain legume species (3-172 kg N ha-1). Net N input by the grain legumes was negatively correlated with grain yield, and legume grain yields of above 1 Mg ha-1 resulted in negative net N inputs. Economic benefits of fitting legumes into the smallholder cropping systems in rotation with maize varied with rainfall, soil fertility and legume species. Yearly maize productivity of these rotations (short and long rains crops) decreased by 47{\%}, from AEZ 1 to AEZ 3, and by 33{\%}, from fertile fields to least fertile fields. Although continuous maize fertilized with both N and P had the largest total maize productivity, returns to land and labour were greatest with grain legume-maize cropping systems. In AEZ 2, where moisture was not limiting during the experimentation period, mean returns to land for grain legume-maize cropping systems were US{\$} 879 ha-1, compared with US{\$} 533 for green manure- maize, and US{\$} 459 for continuous maize with N and P. Rainfall, soil fertility, land, labour, and livestock ownership were identified as the most important factors influencing the choice of appropriate legumes for the smallholder socio-ecological niches. The analysis of the current legume production situation showed that the medium and the low resource endowed farmers were food insecure due to a combination of land and labour scarcity. However, when alternative legumes species selected according to the socio-ecological niche concept were used, maize self-sufficiency increased by 21-48{\%}. This study demonstrated the utility of the socio-ecological niche concept as a useful tool for facilitating the integration of legumes into the western Kenya smallholder farming systems to improve soil fertility and farm productivity.},

abstract = {There is an increasing evidence that smallholder farms contribute substantially to food production globally, yet spatially explicit data on agricultural field sizes are currently lacking. Automated field size delineation using remote sensing or the estimation of average farm size at subnational level using census data are two approaches that have been used. However, both have limitations, for example, automatic field size delineation using remote sensing has not yet been implemented at a global scale while the spatial resolution is very coarse when using census data. This paper demonstrates a unique approach to quantifying and mapping agricultural field size globally using crowdsourcing. A campaign was run in June 2017, where participants were asked to visually interpret very high resolution satellite imagery from Google Maps and Bing using the Geo-Wiki application. During the campaign, participants collected field size data for 130 K unique locations around the globe. Using this sample, we have produced the most accurate global field size map to date and estimated the percentage of different field sizes, ranging from very small to very large, in agricultural areas at global, continental, and national levels. The results show that smallholder farms occupy up to 40{\%} of agricultural areas globally, which means that, potentially, there are many more smallholder farms in comparison with the two different current global estimates of 12{\%} and 24{\%}. The global field size map and the crowdsourced data set are openly available and can be used for integrated assessment modeling, comparative studies of agricultural dynamics across different contexts, for training and validation of remote sensing field size delineation, and potential contributions to the Sustainable Development Goal of Ending hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.},

abstract = {A comprehensive long-term fertilizer trial programme for annual crops was established in 1985 at 70 sites in the high and medium rainfall areas of Kenya testing N and P, farmyard manure and other critical nutrients. Sites were selected according to their representativeness regarding soils and climate in agro-ecological units. The fertilizer trial programme included all major food crops typical for the respective area, both monocropped and intercropped in the case of cereals. Economic optimum fertilizer rates were calculated taking into account input/output price ratios and value-cost ratios. The majority of sites showed responses to N or P, only at one site response to both N and P with a significant interaction was found. Price elasticity of crops such as potatoes and cabbages was higher than that of maize or sorghum. Critical soil P levels were determined for maize at 13 ppm P for modified Olsen extract and 32 ppm P for Mehlich I extract. Variability of rainfall was found to greatly influence viability of fertilizer recommendations. First attempts to extrapolate fertilizer recommendations from areas of representativeness to areas with similar conditions by means of GIS and modelling approaches are discussed.},

abstract = {An assessment of post-harvest handling practices and food losses in a maize-based farming system in semi-arid areas of Central and Northern Tanzania was carried out in 2012. Seventeen crops were mostly cultivated by the farmers in the surveyed areas; maize (32{\%}), sunflower (16{\%}) and pigeon peas (12{\%}) were the most cultivated while maize was the most stored. There are at least 7 months between two harvest seasons of each crop; while farmers sold the crops soon after harvest to cater for household expenditure (54{\%}) and school fees (38{\%}), the market prices increased significantly (P≤0.05) within six months of storage. Most processing activities (winnowing, dehulling, drying, sorting and shelling) were carried out manually, almost entirely by women, but mechanized processing for maize, sunflower, millet, and sorghum were commonly practiced. Quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur in the field (15{\%}); during processing (13-20{\%}), and during storage (15-25{\%}). The main storage pests responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), grain weevils (Sitophilus granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in weather (40{\%}), field damage (33{\%}), and storage pests (16{\%}) as the three most important factors causing poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. However, survey results suggest that the farmers' poor knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the food losses. 77{\%} of the surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41{\%} received food aid during the previous year. Increasing farmers' technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability, and training on post-harvest management could reduce food losses, and improve poverty and household food security. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Agroforestry is an intensive land management system that integrates trees into land already used for crop and animal farming. This provides a diverse range of ecosystem services by bridging the gaps between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. It is an important approach to improve the environmental, economic, and social benefits of complex social-ecological systems in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper aims to examine the research trends in agroforestry and the current state of knowledge, as well as the research gaps in the ecosystem services of agroforestry in this region. A systematic mapping methodology was applied, where analysis units were academic articles related to agroforestry practices in the Asia-Pacific region. The articles published between 1970 and 2018 were collected through the international specialized academic database, SCOPUS. They were coded according to the types of agroforestry practices and ecosystem services. The research result indicates silvorable systems, especially plantation crop combinations, tree management, habitats for species, biological controls, and maintenance of genetic diversity and gene-pools, are the most prominent in the agroforestry research from the Asia-Pacific region. Approximately 60{\%} of all research articles include case studies from India, China, Indonesia, and Australia. Research on agroforestry has changed following the international discourse on climate change and biodiversity. Therefore, this systematic map improves our understanding of the nature, volume, and characteristics of the research on ecosystem services with regard to agroforestry in the Asia-Pacific region. It provides scholars with a springboard for further meta-analysis or research on agroforestry and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Biodiversity studies rely heavily on estimates of species' distributions often obtained through ecological niche modelling. Numerous software packages exist that allow users to model ecological niches using machine learning and statistical methods. However, no existing package with a graphical user interface allows users to perform model calibration and selection based on convex forms such as ellipsoids, which may match fundamental ecological niche shapes better, incorporating tools for exploring, modelling, and evaluating niches and distributions that are intuitive for both novice and proficient users. Here we describe an r package, NicheToolBox (ntbox), that allows users to conduct all processing steps involved in ecological niche modelling: downloading and curating occurrence data, obtaining and transforming environmental data layers, selecting environmental variables, exploring relationships between geographic and environmental spaces, calibrating and selecting ellipsoid models, evaluating models using binomial and partial ROC tests, assessing extrapolation risk, and performing geographic information system operations via a graphical user interface. A summary of the entire workflow is produced for use as a stand-alone algorithm or as part of research reports. The method is explained in detail and tested via modelling the threatened feline species Leopardus wiedii. Georeferenced occurrence data for this species are queried to display both point occurrences and the IUCN extent of occurrence polygon (IUCN, 2007). This information is used to illustrate tools available for accessing, processing and exploring biodiversity data (e.g. number of occurrences and chronology of collecting) and transforming environmental data (e.g. a summary PCA for 19 bioclimatic layers). Visualizations of three-dimensional ecological niches modelled as minimum volume ellipsoids are developed with ancillary statistics. This niche model is then projected to geographic space, to represent a corresponding potential suitability map. Using ntbox allows a fast and straightforward means by which to retrieve and manipulate occurrence and environmental data, which can then be implemented in model calibration, projection and evaluation for assessing distributions of species in geographic space and their corresponding environmental combinations.},

abstract = {Forest vulnerability to drought is expected to increase under anthropogenic climate change, and drought-induced mortality and community dynamics following drought have major ecological and societal impacts. Here,we showthat tree mortality concomitant with drought has led to short-term (mean 5 y, range 1 to 23 y after mortality) vegetation-type conversion in multiple biomes across the world (131 sites). Self-replacement of the dominant tree species was only prevalent in 21{\%} of the examined cases and forests and woodlands shifted to nonwoody vegetation in 10{\%} of them. The ultimate temporal persistence of such changes remains unknown but, given the key role of biological legacies in long-term ecological succession, this emerging picture of postdrought ecological trajectories highlights the potential for major ecosystem reorganization in the coming decades. Community changes were less pronounced under wetter postmortality conditions. Replacement was also influenced by management intensity, and postdrought shrub dominance was higher when pathogens acted as codrivers of tree mortality. Early change in community composition indicates that forests dominated by mesic species generally shifted toward more xeric communities, with replacing tree and shrub species exhibiting drier bioclimatic optima and distribution ranges. However, shifts toward more mesic communities also occurred and multiple pathways of forest replacement were observed for some species. Drought characteristics, species-specific environmental preferences, plant traits, and ecosystem legacies govern postdrought species turnover and subsequent ecological trajectories, with potential far-reaching implications for forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control. Each decision support system is analyzed under a systematic manner. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research.},

abstract = {Climbing bean is the key staple legume crop in the highlands of East and Central Africa. We assessed the impact of interactions between soil fertility characteristics, crop management and socio-economic factors, such as household resource endowment and gender of the farmer, on climbing bean productivity and yield responses to basal P fertiliser in northern Rwanda. Through a combination of detailed characterisations of 12 farms and on-farm demonstration trials at 110 sites, we evaluated variability in grain yields and responses to fertiliser. Grain yields varied between 0.14 and 6.9 t ha-1 with an overall average of 1.69 t ha-1. Household resource endowment and gender of the farmer was strongly associated with climbing bean yield, even though these were partly confounded with Sector. Poorer households and women farmers achieved lower yields than wealthier households and male farmers. Household resource endowment and gender were likely to act as proxies for a range of agronomic and crop management factors that determine crop productivity, such as soil fertility, current and past access to organic manure and mineral fertiliser, access to sufficient quality staking material, ability to conduct crop management operation on time, but we found evidence for only some of these relationships. Poorer households and female farmers grew beans on soils with poorer soil fertility. Moreover, poorer households had a lower density of stakes, while stake density was strongly correlated with yield. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser application led to a substantial increase in the average grain yield (0.66 t ha-1), but a large variability in responses implied that its use would be economically worthwhile for roughly half of the farmers. For the sake of targeting agricultural innovations to those households that are most likely to adopt, the Ubudehe household typology - a Rwandan government system of wealth categorisation - could be a useful and easily available tool to structure rural households within regions of Rwanda that are relatively uniform in agro-ecology.},

abstract = {Parasitic weeds such as Striga spp and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa in smallholder rice production systems form an increasing problem for food and income security in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper we implement the Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS) as a diagnostic tool to identify specific and generic entry points for innovations to address parasitic weeds in rain-fed rice production in Tanzania. Data were gathered across three study sites in Tanzania where parasitic weeds are eminent (Kyela, Songea Rural and Morogoro Rural districts). The results demonstrate that in Tanzania, weeds in general and parasitic weeds in particular receive little attention in agricultural research, training and education curricula. Crop protection policies mainly focus on the control of (insect) pest and diseases and there is relatively little attention for weed prevention, which is essential for addressing parasitic weed problems effectively. Specific entry points for innovation include increasing awareness of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers and policymakers. In regions where awareness is relatively high, participatory research approaches can provide a basis for developing locally adapted parasitic weed management strategies. Generic entry points for innovation include enhanced collaboration and interaction between stakeholders across different levels, for example in multi-stakeholder platforms. This can provide the basis for developing and implementing coherent policy and development strategies to address structural constraints in the agricultural system, including the promotion of clean local seed systems, investments in physical and knowledge infrastructure development, adequate backstopping of agricultural extension officers, agribusiness training for farmers, quality control of agricultural inputs, timely access to agricultural inputs, and improved access to markets for farmers. Together the specific and generic entry points can strengthen the innovation capacity of Tanzania's agricultural system to address parasitic weed problems, as well as other complex agricultural problems.},

abstract = {Niche complementarity, in which coexisting species use different forms of a resource, has been widely invoked to explain some of the most debated patterns in ecology, including maintenance of diversity and relationships between diversity and ecosystem function. However, classical models assume resource specialization in the form of distinct niches, which does not obviously apply to the broadly overlapping resource use in plant communities. Here we utilize an experimental framework based on competition theory to test whether plants partition resources via classical niche differentiation or via plasticity in resource use. We explore two alternatives: niche preemption, in which individuals respond to a superior competitor by switching to an alternative, less-used resource, and dominant plasticity, in which superior competitors exhibit high resource use plasticity and shift resource use depending on the competitive environment. We determined competitive ability by measuring growth responses with and without neighbors over a growing season and then used 15N tracer techniques to measure uptake of different nitrogen (N) forms in a field setting. We show that four alpine plant species of differing competitive abilities have statistically indistinguishable uptake patterns (nitrate {\textgreater} ammonium {\textgreater} glycine) in their fundamental niche (without competitors) but differ in whether they shift these uptake patterns in their realized niche (with competitors). Competitively superior species increased their uptake of the most available N form, ammonium, when in competition with the rarer, competitively inferior species. In contrast, the competitively inferior species did not alter its N uptake pattern in competition. The existence of plasticity in resource use among the dominant species provides a mechanism that helps to explain the manner by which plant species with broadly overlapping resource use might coexist.},

abstract = {Soil acidity and phosphorus (P) deficiency are some of the major causes of low maize yields in Kenya. This study determined the immediate and residual effects of lime and P fertilizer on soil pH, exchangeable aluminium (Al), available P, maize grain yield, agronomic P use and P fertilizer recovery efficiencies on a western Kenya acid soil. The treatments were: P fertilizer (0, 26 and 52 kg P ha-1 as triple super phosphate) and lime (0, 2, 4 and 6 tons lime ha-1) applied once at the beginning of the study. A burnt liming material with 92.5{\%} calcium carbonate equivalent was used. Soil samples were analysed prior to and after treatment application. The site had low soil pH-H2O (4.9), available P (2.3 mg kg-1), total N (0.17{\%}), high Al (2.0 cmol kg-1 exchangeable Al and 29{\%} Al saturation). Lime reduced soil pH and exchangeable Al, leading to increased soil available P. Lime at 2, 4 and 6 tons ha-1 maintained soil pH ≥ 5.5 for 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively. The study observed that the recommended P fertilizer rate (26 kg P ha-1) for maize production in Kenya was inadequate to raise soil available P to the critical level (≥10 mg P kg -1 soil bicarbonate extractable P) required for healthy maize growth. To maintain soil available P at the critical level where 52 kg P ha -1 and combined 52 kg P ha-1 + 4 tons lime ha-1 were applied, it would be necessary to reapply the same P fertilizer rate after every one and two cropping seasons, respectively. The 4-year mean grain yield increments were 0.17, 0.34, 0.50, 0.58 and 1.17 tons ha-1 due to 2, 4, 6 tons lime ha-1, 26 kg P and 52 kg P ha-1, respectively. Both agronomic P use and P fertilizer recovery efficiencies increased with increasing rates of lime and decreased with increasing rates of P fertilizer. Therefore, combined applications of both lime and P fertilizer are important for enhancing maize production on P-deficient acid soils in western Kenya.

Extension approaches that contribute to the reduction of poverty in this region are needed. One important model right now is farmer field schools (FFS), based on adult education principles such as experiential learning. Farmer field schools are usually an intensive, season-long program where farmers meet weekly to learn and experiment on a given topic. Using document analysis, key informant and group interviews, and personal observation, this paper reviews the FFS philosophy, history, and experiences of applying FFS methodology in the region. It discusses whether FFS could be an alternative to existing extension systems in Eastern and Southern Africa. The paper concludes that FFS are not an alternative to existing systems, but that certain principles of FFS could be picked up and incorporated into various systems, including agricultural extension, research, and even health, to make them more effective at reaching small and marginalized farmers and in alleviating poverty and food insecurity.},

abstract = {Agricultural intensification has been recognized as one of the solutions to increase food production to feed the ever-increasing population in sub-Saharan Africa. This can partly be achieved if quantitative and up-to-date information on soil health indicators are not available. This study used the land health surveillance framework, which combines ground-sampling schemes based on sentinel site and infrared spectroscopy to select a minimum dataset of soil health indicators to identify key land constraints for maize production and target potential interventions. We found high variability in soil properties in the study area which was mainly due to inherent soil conditions and land management practices. The most variable soil properties (CV {\textgreater} 0.38) were nitrogen (N), electric conductivity (ECd), exchangeable bases (ExBas), boron (B), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn) and phosphorus (P). Moderate variability (0.2 {\textless} CV {\textless} 0.38) was observed for carbon (C), silt and sand, while properties with least variability (CV {\textless} 0.2) were pH and aluminium (Al). The effects of land-use and soil depth were significant (p {\textless} 0.05) for most of the soil properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified soil nutrient availability, metal concentration and texture as the three main factors that explain most of the variability observed. Significant interactions were observed between soil properties confirming the need for a minimum dataset of indicators. ExBas, B, pH, Mn, ECd, P and clay content formed the minimum dataset of soil health indicators for the study area. The results also showed that the soils of the study site are marginally suitable for the production of maize (Zea mays L.). Low limitations with respect to exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K and Na) and severe limitations with respect to B ({\textless}0.15 mg kg-1), pH ({\textless}6.20), P ({\textless}6.5 mg kg-1 soil) and clay content ({\textgreater}63{\%}) were detected. However, potential for improvement exists through integrated soil management practices that include the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, minimum soil tillage, and inclusion of legumes in crop rotations that could improve soil physical and chemical properties.},

The drivers of the region's economic transformations are diverse, and include improved governance, strong agricultural growth in some countries, employment expansion in informal rural off-farm activities, strong local and foreign investment, a period of high global commodity prices, and policy reforms undertaken in earlier decades. Agricultural growth, by expanding job opportunities in the non-farm sectors through multiplier effects, is likely to remain an important driver of continued transformation, though it will increasingly need to rely on productivity growth rather than area expansion.},

abstract = {Biodiversity studies rely heavily on estimates of species' distributions often obtained through ecological niche modelling. Numerous software packages exist that allow users to model ecological niches using machine learning and statistical methods. However, no existing package with a graphical user interface allows users to perform model calibration and selection based on convex forms such as ellipsoids, which may match fundamental ecological niche shapes better, incorporating tools for exploring, modelling, and evaluating niches and distributions that are intuitive for both novice and proficient users. Here we describe an r package, NicheToolBox (ntbox), that allows users to conduct all processing steps involved in ecological niche modelling: downloading and curating occurrence data, obtaining and transforming environmental data layers, selecting environmental variables, exploring relationships between geographic and environmental spaces, calibrating and selecting ellipsoid models, evaluating models using binomial and partial ROC tests, assessing extrapolation risk, and performing geographic information system operations via a graphical user interface. A summary of the entire workflow is produced for use as a stand-alone algorithm or as part of research reports. The method is explained in detail and tested via modelling the threatened feline species Leopardus wiedii. Georeferenced occurrence data for this species are queried to display both point occurrences and the IUCN extent of occurrence polygon (IUCN, 2007). This information is used to illustrate tools available for accessing, processing and exploring biodiversity data (e.g. number of occurrences and chronology of collecting) and transforming environmental data (e.g. a summary PCA for 19 bioclimatic layers). Visualizations of three-dimensional ecological niches modelled as minimum volume ellipsoids are developed with ancillary statistics. This niche model is then projected to geographic space, to represent a corresponding potential suitability map. Using ntbox allows a fast and straightforward means by which to retrieve and manipulate occurrence and environmental data, which can then be implemented in model calibration, projection and evaluation for assessing distributions of species in geographic space and their corresponding environmental combinations.},

abstract = {Low fertilizer application rates for several decades have depleted soil nutrients in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and contributed to relatively stagnant maize (Zea mays L.) yields. As maize is a staple crop, nutrient depletion has resulted in major food insecurity. While one potential solution is to apply more nitrogen (N) fertilizer, previous studies in SSA have found maize yield responses to be variable, likely because N is often not the only limiting nutrient. This study aimed to determine the impact of consecutive N fertilizer applications on plant uptake and available soil reserves of non-N nutrients. Maize was grown continuously in 3 sites that were representative of the ecosystem variability found in East/Southern Africa (Embu, Kenya; Kiboko, Kenya; Harare, Zimbabwe) at 4 different N fertilizer rates (0–160 kg N ha−1) from 2010 to 2015. Following the final season, grain, stover, and soil (sampled at different depths to 0.9 m) samples were analyzed for essential plant nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer increased plant uptake of P, S, Cu, and Zn by up to 280{\%}, 320{\%}, 420{\%}, and 210{\%}, respectively, showing potential for mitigating non-N nutrient deficiencies in 2 of the 3 sites. Cumulatively, however, there was a net negative effect of higher N rates on the P, K, and S soil-plant balances in all sites and on the Mn and Cu soil-plant balance in Kiboko, indicating that applying N fertilizer depletes non-N soil nutrients. While N fertilizer enhances the uptake of non-N nutrients, a balanced application of multiple essential nutrients is needed to sustainably increase yields in SSA.},

abstract = {1. Abstract Maize is Kenya's principal crop and is wholly dependent on rainfall, while only about 17{\%} of the country is suitable for rainfed crop production. Despite the great efforts made to increase maize production, the demand has occasionally outstripped the supply, requiring importation of large quantities of maize grain. Producing high maize yields on existing cultivated land is the surest way of generating the extra-required maize because there is limited scope for expanding cultivated land. Traditional farming practices are no longer capable of meeting Kenya's maize production requirements, consequently, widespread application of scientific methods is essential. Foremost, the farming community mush know the potential of the land under cultivation and the essential crop husbandry measures necessary to achieve the maximum possible maize yields without compromising the land's productive sustainability. In the bulk of maize growing areas of Kenya, the yield of maize without fertilisers or manure ranges between 1.1 and 2.5 tha -1 . The levels of maize production results from intricate interactions among the availability of water and nutrients, competition of weeds, occurrence of pests and diseases and the actual management practices. Increasing maize production in Kenya can be approached both at farm and national levels. At the farm level, a number of important measures are necessary: execution of early and better land preparation, timely planting, planting of the most appropriate maize varieties, proper fertilisation, efficient weeding and improved control of pests and diseases while family labour should be used effectively to carry out weeding operations. At the national level, several interventions are essential: enhancing the productivity of fragile, marginal land ecosystems through improving the existing maize varieties to facilitate the expansion of maize production in marginal land areas, breeding germplasm varieties and are acid-tolerant and utilize phosphorus more efficiently, devising techniques to improve rainwater utilization and developing effective residue management practices. Other interventions include: intensification of research to determine the appropriate types and quantities of fertilizers, manures and agricultural lime for different soils and climatic conditions of the country; boosting of agricultural extension services to promote efficient weeding practices particularly by family labour; increasing agricultural credit facilities to enable farmers purchase the necessary inputs, and put in place maize price policies that encourage farmers to increase maize production on a sustainable basis. The formulation of a strategy to pursue sustainable maize production in Kenya is indispensable mainly because of the scarcity of good agricultural land and rapid population growth. Unfortunately, the majority of farmers will not be able to provide adequate inputs in order to increase the current yields and to sustain higher yields.},

Through a survey of 192 KMS users, task interdependence, perceived task technology fit, KMS self-efficacy, and personal outcome expectations were found to have substantial influences on KMS usage.

abstract = {Smallholder agriculture is an important source of livelihoods in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In these regions the highest concentrations of nutritionally vulnerable populations are found. Agricultural development needs to be nutrition-sensitive, and contribute simultaneously to improving household nutrition, farm productivity and environmental performance. We explored the windows of opportunities for farm development and the potential of crop diversification options for meeting household dietary requirements, whilst concurrently improving household economic performance in contrasting smallholder farm systems in Kenya and Vietnam. Farm and household features and farmer perspectives and priorities were integrated into a farm-household model that allowed quantification of a diverse set of nutritional, labour and productive indicators. Using a multi-objective optimization algorithm, we generated ‘solution spaces' comprising crop compositions and management configurations that would satisfy household dietary needs and allowed income gains. Results indicated site-specific synergies between income and nutritional system yield for vitamin A. Diversification with novel vegetables could cover vitamin A requirements of 10 to 31 extra people per hectare and lead to greater income (25 to 185{\%} increase) for some households, but reduced leisure time. Although the Vietnamese sites exhibited greater nutrient system yields than those in Kenya, the household diets in Kenya had greater nutrient adequacy due to the fact that the Vietnamese farmers sold greater proportions of their on-farm produced foods.

abstract = {Agroforestry system has the enormous capacity to achieve social, economic, and environmental goals by optimizing land productivity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the land potentiality in India for agroforestry based on FAO land suitability criteria utilizing various land, soil, climate, and topographic themes. This was achieved in GIS Domain by integrating various thematic layers scientifically. The analysis of land potentiality in India for agroforestry suitability reveals 32.8{\%} as highly suitable (S1), 40.4{\%} moderately suitable (S2), 11.7{\%} marginally suitable (S3), and 9.1{\%} not suitable (NS). About 52{\%} of land of India is under the cropland category. In addition, it revealed that the 46{\%} of these cropland areas fall into high agroforestry suitable category “S1,” and provide huge opportunity for harnessing agroforestry practices. Furthermore, agroforestry suitability mapping in broad ecosystem and in different agroecological regions will assist various projects in India at the regional level. Such results will also boost the various objectives of the National Agroforestry Policy (2014, http://www.cafri.res.in/NAF{\_}Policy.pdf) and policymakers of India where they need to extend it. The potential of geospatial technology can be exploited in the field of agroforestry for the benefit of rural poor people/farmers by ensuring food and ecological security, resilience in livelihoods, and can sustain extreme weather events such as droughts and climate change impact. Such type of research can be replicated in India at village level (local level) to state level (regional level) utilizing the significant themes which affect the agroforestry suitability. This will certainly fetch better results on ground and will significantly assist the management programs.},

abstract = {The technologies that may increase the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of fertilizers N in the future are considered. These technologies can be divided into two main groups: (i) those related to the choice of crop species and the genetic enhancement of the plant that essentially determine the N demand side; and (ii) those concerned with the management options that determine the availability of soil and fertilizer N for plant uptake. The innovative approaches that may result in the better use of existing knowledge are described. Crop selection is based mostly on aggregate traits (acquisition and internal efficiency) over a range of N rates. The three components of NUE measured for different crops or genotypes are: (i) efficiency of acquisition or recovery of soil and fertilizer N; (ii) internal efficiency (IE) with which N is used to produce biomass; and (iii) IE with which N is used to produce grain. The efficiency of use of fertilizer N can be improved by modifying the form of N applied and by changing the way it is use on the farm. Technologies are emerging that allow increased NUE by following any of these three strategies such as prescriptive N management, corrective N management, and combined approaches. A brief discussion on conservation tillage used in maize-soyabean cropping system in the USA and in rice-wheat systems in Asia, is given. Finally, communication and dissemination of emerging technologies including computer-based decision support systems and other approaches to decision support, are discussed.},

abstract = {Intercropping is a common practice on small farms in developing countries. In Kenya, where maize is the staple food, it is common to find maize intercropped with a range of short-term crops such as beans, sunflower, groundnuts, millet, potatoes. Competition between the crops for light, water and nutrients is possible at some stage in the production cycle, and field trials to measure the benefits of intercropping have been inconclusive. SODCOM has been used to analyse the intercropping of maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) in the Kitale region of Kenya. Three cropping situations have been examined: maize alone, beans alone and maize intercropped with beans. The model incorporates modifications which take account of the competition between the intercrops for light and water. The predictions of intercropped yield from the model are found to be in reasonable agreement with the results of field trials among small farmers in the Trans Nzoia District of Kenya over a period of 7 years. Comparing the yields obtained under intercropping with what would have been obtained with both crops grown in pure stands, intercropping has only a minimal effect on the yields of either crop. The yield of the maize, which has a longer growing season than the beans, was found to be sensitive to the degree of moisture stress, which was likely to occur towards the end of the growing season. The main argument against intercropping is that it limits the opportunities for mechanisation beyond seed bed preparation and drilling. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Sub-Sahara Africa can overcome the soil fertility depletion that has resulted from decades of nutrient mining by small-scale farmers and threatens the region's food security. Nutrient restoration is now technically feasible because its mechanisms are understood and the rural development community is alerted to this need. Rapid and inexpensive approaches of diagnosing soil fertility limitations are also becoming available and information generated is becoming systematically applied. For example, the recently initiated Africa Soil Information Service project aims at evaluating, mapping, and monitoring Africa's soil qualities for better targeting of soil fertility management technologies to improve crop yields while enhancing the environment. Practical knowledge is available on nutrient management in small-scale farming systems that combines increased biological nitrogen fixation, utilizes agromineral resources such as phosphate rock, better uses organic resources, and more efficiently applies mineral fertilizers. The new approach to managing soil nutrients, recognized as integrated soil fertility management, aims to increase food production through strategic combination of traditional and new technologies and is being stimulated through increased availability and more profitable use of mineral fertilizers by Africa's poorer farmers. This is building on already existing sparks of hope for restoring soil fertility in sub-Saharan Africa derived from such examples as the increasing adoption of the za{\"{i}}-type of pitting system originated in drier parts of West Africa which exemplifies the beneficial effects of integrating harvesting of water and applying nutrient sources at each planting station so as to increase yield in a region where both necessities are key limiting factors. Nitrogen fixation by indigenous and introduced legumes combined with improved agronomic practices has shown potential for kick-starting self-multiplying improvements in soil productivity. Such successes will be accelerated by broader initiatives which improve rural infrastructure, increase accessibility of inputs, improve marketing facilities, and make reinvestment into farming more productive and sustainable. Indeed, experience indicates that investments in farming and, by inference, soil fertility conservation are made when economic returns from smallholder production are sufficient to do so. So, while technical advances leading to improvements in farming practice must continue, policymakers must also recognize that agriculture ultimately forms the basis for economic recovery and act upon past promises to invest in agriculture, including the restoration of nutrient-depleted soils. Investments must address factors that have impacts both on the broad reforms for provision of services such as marketing and trade, as well as those directly constraining the poor farmers such as capacity to access and efficiently apply fertilizers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Grain legumes play a key role in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in relation to food and nutrition security and income generation. Moreover, because of their N2-fixation capacity, such legumes can also have a positive influence on soil fertility. Notwithstanding many decades of research on the agronomy of grain legumes, their N2-fixation capacity, and their contribution to overall system productivity, several issues remain to be resolved to realize fully the benefits of grain legumes. In this paper we highlight major lessons learnt and expose key knowledge gaps in relation to grain legumes and their contributions to farming system productivity. The symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia forms the basis for its benefits and biological N2-fixation (BNF) relies as much on the legume genotype as on the rhizobial strains. As such, breeding grain legumes for BNF deserves considerably more attention. Even promiscuous varieties usually respond to inoculation, and as African soils contain a huge pool of unexploited biodiversity with potential to contribute elite rhizobial strains, strain selection should go hand-in-hand with legume breeding for N2-fixation. Although inoculated strains can outcompete indigenous strains, our understanding of what constitutes a good competitor is rudimentary, as well as which factors affect the persistence of inoculated rhizobia, which in its turn determines whether a farmer needs to re-inoculate each and every season. Although it is commonly assumed that indigenous rhizobia are better adapted to local conditions than elite strains used in inoculants, there is little evidence that this is the case. The problems of delivering inoculants to smallholders through poorly-developed supply chains in Africa necessitates inoculants based on sterile carriers with long shelf life. Other factors critical for a well-functioning symbiosis are also central to the overall productivity of grain legumes. Good agronomic practices, including the use of phosphorus (P)-containing fertilizer, improve legume yields though responses to inputs are usually very variable. In some situations, a considerable proportion of soils show no response of legumes to applied inputs, often referred to as non-responsive soils. Understanding the causes underlying this phenomenon is limited and hinders the uptake of legume agronomy practices. Grain legumes also contribute to the productivity of farming systems, although such effects are commonly greater in rotational than in intercropping systems. While most cropping systems allow for the integration of legumes, intercropped legumes provide only marginal benefits to associated crops. Important rotational benefits have been shown for most grain legumes though those with the highest N accumulation and lowest N harvest index appear to demonstrate higher residual benefits. N balance estimates often results in contradictory observations, mostly caused by the lack of understanding of belowground contributions of legumes to the N balance. Lastly, the ultimate condition for increased uptake of grain legumes by smallholder farmers lies in the understanding of how legume technologies and management practices can be tailored to the enormous diversity of agroecologies, farming systems, and smallholder farms in SSA. In conclusion, while research on grain legumes has revealed a number of important insights that will guide realization of the full potential of such legumes to the sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in SSA, many research challenges remain to be addressed to realize the full potential of BNF in these systems.},

abstract = {The farm size and productivity debate has been limited by the focus on land or labor productivity, generally showing respective productivity advantages to smaller or larger sized farms. Our purpose is to provide new perspectives on the debate by bringing together evidence from a set of novel case studies in both rich and poor countries. Common to them are the adoption of total factor productivity (TFP) as the comparative performance measure, and the reliance on panels of farm micro data. The present article presents a synthesis of findings from five case studies in (i) Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda; (ii) Bangladesh; (iii) Brazil; (iv) Australia; and (v) the United States. The preponderance of evidence from these studies suggests that there is no single economically optimal agrarian structure; rather, it appears to evolve with the stage of economic development. Certain farm sizes face relative productivity advantages, such as small farms in Africa. But with economic and market growth, that smallholder advantage will likely attenuate, moving toward constant and eventually increasing returns to size. Yet, importantly, small farms may be quite dynamic, and need not be a drag on agricultural growth until perhaps well into the development process.},

However, most applications deal with (semi-)detailed soil surveys where soil variability is determined by a limited number of soil forming factors. The question that remains is whether digital soil mapping techniques are equally suitable for exploratory or reconnaissance soil surveys in more extensive areas with limited data availability. We applied digital soil mapping in a 13,500 km2 study area in Kenya with the main aim to create a reconnaissance soil map to assess clay and soil organic carbon contents in terraced maize fields. Soil spatial variability prediction was based on environmental correlation using the concepts of the soil forming factors equation. During field work, 95 composite soil samples were collected. Auxiliary spatially exhaustive data provided insight on the spatial variation of climate, land cover, topography and parent material. The final digital soil maps were elaborated using regression kriging. The variance explained by the regression kriging models was estimated as 13{\%} and 37{\%} for soil organic carbon and clay respectively. These results were confirmed by cross-validation and provide a significant improvement compared to the existing soil survey. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Land degradation is a critical challenge to sustainable development. This paper examines factors that shape farmer decision-making around sustainable land management (SLM) practices in Tanzania and Malawi. It seeks to understand the contradictions that often exist between what research recommends, projects promote and donors invest in and what SLM options farmers actually choose to implement. It focuses on the costs, benefits and economic drivers that shape farmer's willingness and ability to invest in SLM (or that force them into situations that result in land degradation). The SLM techniques most commonly practiced, and which farmers express the greatest preference for, are often not those that yield the highest production gains, generate the greatest income, or involve the lowest costs. Meanwhile, other apparently profitable SLM techniques show relatively low rates of adoption. Farmers highlighted a wide range of non-monetary attributes and characteristics that determine whether they consider an SLM option to be economically attractive, viable and sustainable. These findings underscore the need to think beyond simple benefit/cost-based measures when prioritizing SLM interventions. Farmers' needs, aspirations and preferences extend far beyond efforts to maximize short-term income and production gains or to minimize direct outlays and cash expenditures. We also found that significant gaps often exist between the SLM decisions farmers would like to make and those that they are actually able to undertake, given their economic circumstances and the resources available to them. If these broader economic factors and drivers of farmers' land management decisions are not considered in SLM policy, research, planning and implementation, there is a risk that proposed interventions will do little either to address the root causes of land degradation or to meet farmers' needs and aspirations.},

abstract = {There is a lot of interest in the contribution that agroforestry can make to reverse land degradation and create resilient multifunctional landscapes that provide a range of socio-economic benefits. The agroforestry research agenda has been characterized by approaches that promote a few priority tree species, within a restricted set of technological packages. These have often not spread widely beyond project sites, because they fail to take account of fine scale variation in farmer circumstances. New methods are needed to generate diverse sets of agroforestry options that can reconcile production and conservation objectives and embrace varying local conditions across large scaling domains. Here, we document a novel approach that couples local knowledge acquisition with structured stakeholder engagement to build an inclusive way of designing agroforestry options. We applied this approach in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where armed conflict, erratic governance and poverty have resulted in severe pressure on forests in the Virunga National Park, a global biodiversity hotspot. Around the park, natural resources and land are severely degraded, whereas most reforestation interventions have consisted of exotic monocultures dominated by Eucalyptus species grown as energy or timber woodlots mainly by male farmers with sufficient land to allocate some exclusively to trees. We found that structured stakeholder engagement led to a quick identification of a much greater diversity of trees (more than 70 species) to be recommended for use within varied field, farm and landscape niches, serving the interests of a much greater diversity of people, including women and marginalized groups. The process also identified key interventions to improve the enabling environment required to scale up the adoption of agroforestry. These included improving access to quality tree planting material, capacity strengthening within the largely non-governmental extension system, and collective action to support value capture from agroforestry products, through processing and market interventions. Integrating local and global scientific knowledge, coupled with facilitating broad-based stakeholder participation, resulted in shifting from reliance on a few priority tree species to promoting tree diversity across the Virunga landscape that could underpin more productive and resilient livelihoods. The approach is relevant for scaling up agroforestry more generally.},

abstract = {Soil acidification threatens dryland crop production in the inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW). Our objective was to assess the efficacy of lime to lower soil acidity, alter Al chemistry, and increase crop yield in a direct-seeded system. Treatments of subsurface banded fertilizer (120-168 kg N ha-1 yr-1) alone or with subsurface banded lime (224 kg ha-1 yr-1), or a one-time broadcast application of lime (7000 kg ha -1) or elemental S (1000 kg ha-1) were initiated in spring 2002. Grain yield was measured annually from 2002 to 2005 in a spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-winter wheat rotation. Soil was sampled in spring 2004 to assess pH and model Al speciation. Low pH was evident at the depth of fertilizer placement (5-10 cm). Broadcast lime increased pH in the surface 15 cm, although reductions in Al3+ activity [(Al3+)] occurred only in the 0- to 5-cm layer. Relative to banded N, there was no increase in pH at the 5- to 10-cm depth where banded lime was placed. At the 0- to 5-cm depth, lower pHs were observed with broadcast S (4.6) compared with the banded N control (5.1) or banded lime (5.0). There was no effect of treatment on yield. Modeling suggests that soluble Al is dominated by otganic matter-Al complexes (fulvic acid, FA; FA2Al+ and FA2AlOH0). Solid- and solution-phase organic complexes may control (Al3+) at pH {\textless}5.5. Although acidification is a concern in the IPNW, the high organic matter content in direct-seeded soils may buffer against Al phytotoxicity. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Western Kenya is one of Africa's most densely populated rural areas, characterised by intensive smallholder crop-livestock systems on degraded lands managed with small inputs of mineral fertiliser and animal manure. Competing uses for crop residues and other organic resources often results in poor nutrient cycling efficiencies at farm scale. Modifying livestock feeding, retaining more crop residues in the field, and improving manure management can help conserving considerable amount of nutrients on-farm. To examine to what extent such strategies would be feasible, we analysed whole-farm nutrient cycling efficiencies (NCE) of a range of farms differing in resource-endowment and production orientation, identifying the most efficient farmer strategies considering labour and financial constraints. Nutrient concentration in excreted cattle manure was relatively small (i.e., N{\textless}1.7{\%}; P{\textless}0.6{\%}). Current manure management practices led to low NCE's (average 27{\%}) due to nutrient losses from excretion through storage and application. Farmers have few incentives to improve manure management given the small amounts of excreta and nutrients to be recycled. Yet, manure, both composted and fresh, represented the greatest N (16kgha-1 season-1) and C returns to the soil (312kg C ha-1 season-1). Retention of crop residues was the cheapest source of nutrient inputs for the next crop, especially when compared with manure, but farmers prioritised its use for cattle feeding. Our findings highlight the critical lack of nutrients and organic residues on smallholder farms in the densely-populated highlands of East Africa, as well as low NCE when it comes to manure. In these conditions, efficient nutrient cycling for manure and improved cattle feeding are essential to increase use efficiencies of any possible external nutrient added in these farms.},

The objectives of this study were to show the beneficial use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in agriculture among the youth in Kenya, assessed ICT application and commonly used tools, experienced challenges, impacts and suggested future ICT use. Beneficial ICT applications were exemplified by 'Mkulima Young Champions' who led digital initiatives, drew youth into farming, helped them learn among themselves, and traded and overcame agricultural challenges. Using radio, short message services (SMS) and social media, they discussed agricultural topics and shared successes. Mkulima Young's Facebook was vibrant. The youth posted photographs and videos, asked questions, discussed issues and interacted. Most of the youth obtained information from the internet, hence the internet was the best platform to market and promote agriculture to the youth. They used internet and social media to obtain production technologies, market information and for information sharing. Most commonly used tools were MS Office and spreadsheets for record keeping. Voice messages and SMS assisted timely accessing of market prices, reaching clients, sharing production information and money transactions. The ICT content should be relevant to targeted youth, valuable, localized and dependable. The ICT-savvy youth operated intensive, efficient and profitable farms, producing diverse and branded products for niche markets. The youth transformed the community use and access to ICTs and influenced community economic status. Smart phone technology will revolutionize access to and use of ICTs.

The interviews were designed to elicit participant views on decision-making drivers and farm management goals, especially related to natural resource stewardship. In this paper we examine perceived self-efficacy as a determinant of conservation behavior. Study findings highlight multiple constraints to conservation agriculture, including low perceived self-efficacy, regardless of motivation. These results suggest that programs and policies designed to elevate self-efficacy may be helpful for increasing conservation behavior. In particular, we suggest empowering feedback loops as a mechanism to build self-efficacy among farmers and agricultural landowners. Improved understanding of farmer decision-making drivers and self-efficacy sources and constraints will likely aid natural resource professionals and policy makers in designing and implementing agricultural conservation programs and policies that are more closely aligned with goals and values of farmers, and will thus be helpful in achieving state and local water conservation goals.},

Yet, these analyses neglect temporal yield stability, or the variability and reliability of production across years. Here we perform a meta-analysis to assess temporal yield stability of three major cropping systems: organic agriculture and conservation agriculture (no-tillage) vs. conventional agriculture, comparing 193 studies based on 2896 comparisons. Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a significantly lower temporal stability (−15{\%}) compared to conventional agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on reducing its yield variability. Our analysis further indicates that the use of green manure and enhanced fertilisation can reduce the yield stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture. The temporal stability (−3{\%}) of no-tillage does not differ significantly from those of conventional tillage indicating that a transition to no-tillage does not affect yield stability.},

Affordance is defined as a function provided by an object through an interaction with a user. We first present a conceptual framework to assess the affordances of SA tools. This framework is then applied in a literature review of three SA tools used in agricultural systems research (fuzzy cognitive mapping, bio-economic whole-farm models, and role play and serious games). Through this exercise, we extend the SA tool design and implementation dialogue by illuminating (i) links between lower-level affordances, tool design, and heuristic functioning, and (ii) the central role of use setting and facilitation in mobilizing higher-level, productive affordances. Based on our findings, we make five propositions for how SA tool design and implementation in participatory problem-solving settings can be improved.},

abstract = {Dependence on uncertain rainfall and exposure to unmitigated climate risk are major obstacles in efforts to sustainably intensify agricultural production and enhance rural livelihoods. There is generally enough seasonal total rainfall; the challenge is its poor distribution over time and across the season. The amount of water available to plants strongly depends on the rainy season's onset, length, temporal distribution and cessation and can indirectly indicate the climatic suitability of the crop and its chances of success or failure in a season. Thus, the objective was to determine rainfall pattern; temporal distribution, onset, cessation and length of growing seasons in the tropical sub-humid and a semi-arid regions with contrasting rainfall patterns and agricultural potential in central highlands of Kenya. The study was carried out in Maara and Meru South Sub-Counties in Tharaka Nithi County and Mbeere North and South Sub-Counties in Embu County of the central highlands of Kenya (CHK). Central highlands of Kenya cover both areas with high potential for crop production and low potential, attributed to rainfall differences. Meteorological data were sourced from Kenya Metrological Department (KMD) headquarters and research stations within the study areas. Length of growing season, onset and cessation dates for both Long (LR) and short (SR) rains seasons were determined based on historical rainfall data using RAIN software and derived using various spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS software and presented spatially. Generally there was high frequency of dry spells of at least 5 days length in all the sites with Kiamaogo site having the highest (84 occurrences during LR season) and Kiambere having the least (44 occurrences during LR season) in 10 years. The occurrence of dry spells longer than 15 days in a season was more rampant in the lower altitude parts (semi-arid regions) of the study area as reflected by the Kiambere, Kiritiri, Machang'a and Kamburu sites in both seasons. For the higher altitude regions, average LR onset, representative of the normal/conventional growing period, ranged from 22nd to 26th March to end of April in the region. For the lower altitude region, it ranged from 16th to 30th March. For SR, onset was generally earlier in the high altitude areas with Kiamaogo having the earliest on 13th October. In the low altitude region, onset was comparatively late compared to the higher potential region, but unlike the LR season, spatial and temporal variation was narrower. The high frequency of dry spells more than 15 days long, coupled with the generally low total amount of rainfall receive per season makes agriculture a risk venture. Homogeneity test revealed that the generated onset and cessation dates for the two rain seasons were homogeneous over the 10 years for each of the seven stations. This indicates that, there has been no shift in onset and cessation within the period under consideration. Dynamic derivation of the spatial onset and cessation data at a local scale can be useful in monitoring shifts in onset dates and hence advice small scale farmers and other stakeholders in agriculture sector accordingly in the quest for enhanced agricultural productivity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Food security in the East African Highlands is dependent upon the productivity of lands managed by smallholders who face difficult challenges in maintaining the fertility of their soils. A study was conducted to identify indicators of soil fertility status that are consistent with farmers' perceptions of soil fertility. Physical, chemical and biological properties of soils were measured from paired fields identified as either productive or non-productive by 12 farmers and compared to findings of a household survey on soil fertility management. Special attention was given to the potential of different soil organic matter fractions to serve as diagnostic indicators of soil fertility. Farmers' criteria for distinguishing soil productivity included crop performance, soil tilth, moisture and colour and presence of weeds and soil invertebrates. All farmers attributed low fertility to inadequate use of organic and inorganic fertilisers (100{\%}) and removal of crop residues (100{\%}). Other causes included continuous cropping (83{\%}), lack of crop rotation (66{\%}) and soil erosion (42{\%}). Productive soils had significantly higher soil pH, effective cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cations, extractable P and total N and P than non-productive soils. Total organic C and several estimates of soil labile C including particulate organic C (POC), three Ludox density separates of POC, KMnO4-oxidizable C and microbial biomass C were significantly greater in productive soils. Soil microbial biomass N, net N mineralisation and soil respiration were also significantly higher in productive soils. Farmers' perceptions of soil quality were substantiated through soil chemical analyses and soil organic matter fractions provided precise information on these differences. The similarity of soil physical properties in productive and non-productive fields suggests that differences in chemical and biological indicators may have resulted, in part, from smallholders' management and are not inherent properties of the soils.

abstract = {African mixed crop–livestock systems are vulnerable to climate change and need to adapt in order to improve productivity and sustain people's livelihoods. These smallholder systems are characterized by high greenhouse gas emission rates, but could play a role in their mitigation. Although the impact of climate change is projected to be large, many uncertainties persist, in particular with respect to impacts on livestock and grazing components, whole-farm dynamics and heterogeneous farm populations. We summarize the current understanding on impacts and vulnerability and highlight key knowledge gaps for the separate system components and the mixed farming systems as a whole. Numerous adaptation and mitigation options exist for crop–livestock systems. We provide an overview by distinguishing risk management, diversification and sustainable intensification strategies, and by focusing on the contribution to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture. Despite the potential solutions, smallholders face major constraints at various scales, including small farm sizes, the lack of response to the proposed measures and the multi-functionality of the livestock herd. Major institutional barriers include poor access to markets and relevant knowledge, land tenure insecurity and the common property status of most grazing resources. These limit the adoption potential and hence the potential impact on resilience and mitigation. In order to effectively inform decision-making, we therefore call for integrated, system-oriented impact assessments and a realistic consideration of the adoption constraints in smallholder systems. Building on agricultural system model development, integrated impact assessments and scenario analyses can inform the co-design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies.F},

abstract = {Secondary and micronutrients are important in enhancing crop productivity; yet, they are hardly studied in sub-Sahara Africa. In this region, the main focus has been on macronutrients but there is emerging though scattered evidence of crop productivity limitations by the secondary and micronutrients. Elsewhere, widespread deficiencies of these nutrients are associated with stagnation of yields. Here, we undertake a meta-analysis using 40 articles reporting crop response to secondary and micronutrients to (1) determine the productivity increase of crops and nutrient use efficiency associated with these nutrients, and (2) provide synthesis of responses to secondary nutrients and micronutrients in sub-Sahara Africa. This study used 757 yield data rows (530 from publications and 227 from Africa Soil Information Service) from field trials carried out in SSA between 1969 and 2013 in 14 countries. Data from publications constituted response to S (49.4{\%}), Zn (23.0{\%}), S and micronutrient combinations (11.5{\%}), and {\textless}10{\%} each for Cu, Mo, Fe, and B. Data from Africa Soil Information Service were all for S and micronutrient combinations. Of the two sources, most yield data are for maize (73.6{\%}), followed by sorghum (6.7{\%}) and wheat (6.1{\%}) while rice, cowpea, faba bean, tef, and soybean each accounted for less than 5{\%}. The major points are the following: (1) application of S and micronutrients increased maize yield by 0.84 t ha−1 (i.e., 25{\%}) over macronutrient only treatment and achieved agronomic efficiencies (kilograms of grain increase per kilogram of micronutrient added) between 38 and 432 and (2) response ratios were {\textgreater}1 for S and all micronutrients, i.e., the probability of response ratio exceeding 1 was 0.77 for S and 0.83 for Zn, 0.95 for Cu, and 0.92 for Fe, and indicates positive crop response for a majority of farmers. We conclude that S and micronutrients are holding back crop productivity especially on soils where response to macronutrients is low and that more research is needed to unravel conditions under which application of S and micronutrients may pose financial risks.},

Achieving SI requires smallholder farmers to have access to information that is context-specific, increases their decision-making capacities, and adapts to changing environments. Current extension services often struggle to address these needs. New mobile phone-based services can help. In order to enhance the public extension service in Tanzania, we created a digital service that addresses smallholder farmers' different information needs for implementing SI. Using a co-design methodology–User-Centered Design–we elicited feedback from farmers and extension agents in Tanzania to create a new digital information service, called Ushauri. This automated hotline gives farmers access to a set of pre-recorded messages. Additionally, farmers can ask questions in a mailbox. Extension agents then listen to these questions through an online platform, where they record and send replies via automated push-calls. A test with 97 farmers in Tanzania showed that farmers actively engaged with the service to access agricultural advice. Extension agents were able to answer questions with reduced workload compared to conventional communication channels. This study illustrates how User-Centered Design can be used to develop information services for complex and resource-restricted smallholder farming contexts.},

abstract = {The study reflects on previous World Bank and FAO reports that made the general recommendation to set both research and extension investment targets in developing countries at 1{\%} of agricultural gross domestic product (AgGDP). In order to define proxies for country-specific extension investment targets, authors developed an extension investment model (EIM) based on socio-economic macro-indicators (poverty, undernourishment, access to information and population density) and a method to define estimates for cost increases related to climate change. These parameters helped estimating the demand for agricultural extension and investments required for it. Results showed that about half of the 94 developing and emerging countries should spend more than 1{\%} of their respective share of GDP derived from agriculture and about a quarter of the countries, mostly in Africa and South East Asia, need to spend more than 2{\%} of their AgGDP. The paper reveals significant differences in average investment requirements in different regions and shows the additional extension costs related to climate change and other areas that currently lack investment.},

abstract = {There is consensus that the global food system is not delivering good nutrition for all and is causing environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity, such that a profound transformation is needed to meet the challenges of persistent malnutrition and rural poverty, aggravated by the growing consequences of climate change. Agroecological approaches have gained prominence in scientific, agricultural and political discourse in recent years, suggesting pathways to transform agricultural and food systems that address these issues. Here we present an extensive literature review of concepts, definitions and principles of agroecology, and their historical evolution, considering the three manifestations of agroecology as a science, a set of practices and a social movement; and relate them to the recent dialogue establishing a set of ten iconic elements of agroecology that have emerged from a global multi-stakeholder consultation and synthesis process. Based on this, a consolidated list of principles is developed and discussed in the context of presenting transition pathways to more sustainable food systems. The major outcomes of this paper are as follows. (1) Definition of 13 consolidated agroecological principles: recycling; input reduction; soil health; animal health; biodiversity; synergy; economic diversification; co-creation of knowledge; social values and diets; fairness; connectivity; land and natural resource governance; participation. (2) Confirmation that these principles are well aligned and complementary to the 10 elements of agroecology developed by FAO but articulate requirements of soil and animal health more explicitly and distinguish between biodiversity and economic diversification. (3) Clarification that application of these generic principles can generate diverse pathways for incremental and transformational change towards more sustainable farming and food systems. (4) Identification of four key entry points associated with the elements: diversity; circular and solidarity economy; co-creation and sharing of knowledge; and, responsible governance to enable plausible pathways of transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems.},

However, there is insufficient evidence demonstrating the combined effect of rainfall variability, soil heterogeneity and agroforestry treatment on maize productivity in semi-arid Kenya. We evaluated performance of agroforestry trees (Vachellia seyal, V. xanthophloea, Cordia africana, Faidherbia albida and Grevillea robusta) in monoculture and mixed-species treatments in a long-term experiment in Kiambu, Kenya, and their influence on maize intercrop. The trial was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design having a mix of Cambisol and Vertisol soils. Tree growth and phenology was monitored monthly while maize yield assessed in four cropping seasons. Growth was higher in 2014 for all species compared to other years (P {\textless} .001). Cordia africana and F. albida in mixed stand and Cambisols exceeded those in monoculture and Vertisols (P {\textless} .001). Maize yield grown under C. africana and mixed-species during 2015/16 season was 54{\%} and 44{\%} higher than the control with corresponding canopy transmittance values of 18{\%} and 24{\%} respectively. Maize yield was highest in 2013/14 season (4.2 t ha−1) with rainfall distribution affecting productivity in 2014/15 season whereby 74{\%} of rainfall was received in 1 month resulting in crop failure. These findings demonstrate the reality of climate (rainfall) variability, and the influence of soil properties heterogeneity while supporting call for mixed-species and encouraging efforts aimed at forecasting rainfall patterns as this affects farming operations.},

abstract = {Agricultural extension in sub-Saharan Africa has often been criticised for its focus on linear knowledge transfer, and limited attention to systemic approaches to service delivery. Currently, the region is experiencing a new-ICT revolution and there are high expectations of new-ICTs to enhance interaction and information exchange in extension service delivery. Using an innovation systems perspective, we distinguish the roles demand-articulation, matching demand and supply, and innovation process management for innovation-intermediaries. The study explores literature on how new-ICT may support these roles, with specific interest in the possibilities of environmental monitoring and new forms of organisation enabled by enhanced connectivity. In order to contribute to the understanding of this area, the paper reports on a comparative study of two new-ICT platforms embedded in Ghanaian public and private extension organisations respectively. We assess the roles that these platforms (aim to) support, and document achievements and constraints based on interviews with extension staff and farmers. The findings indicate that while both platforms aim to support innovation-intermediation roles the focus areas and level of detail differ due to diverging organisational rationales to service delivery. In addition, we see that new-ICTs' potential to support innovation-intermediation roles is far from realised. This is not due to (new) ICTs lacking the capacity to link people in new ways and make information accessible, but due to the wider social, organisational and institutional factors that define the realisation of their potential. Therefore, more conventional modes of interaction around production advice and also credit provision continue to be dominant and better adapted to the situation. However, beyond the two platforms that were developed specifically by and for the extension organisations, there were indications that more informal and self-organised new-ICT initiatives can transform and enhance interaction patterns in innovations systems to achieve collective goals through standard virtual platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram.},

abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is plagued by low productivity and little research is available on the attainable responses and profitability to applied nutrients under variable environments. The objective of this study was to determine the attainable maize grain response to and potential of profitability of N, P and K application in SSA using boundary line approaches. Data from experiments conducted in SSA under AfSIS project (2009–2012) and from FAO trials database (1969–1996) in 15 countries and constituting over 375 different experimental locations and 6600 data points are used. Both response to fertilizer and value cost ratio (VCR) are highly variable and no more than 61 {\%} cases for N, 43 {\%} for P and 25 {\%} for K attain VCR of 2 or more. Also, based on the recent AfSIS data, VCR exceeds 1 in just 67 {\%} (N), 57 {\%} (P) and 40 {\%} (K) of the cases, even when best management practices are applied on a research farm, and interest rates are zero. Chances for profitability are highest when soil organic carbon is 1–2 {\%} and control maize grain yield is 1–3 t ha−1 but also depends on relatively static soil properties (primarily texture and mineralogy) that are not under farmer control. We conclude that return on investment of macronutrient fertilizer is highly variable and can be substantially increased by helping farmers decide where to apply the fertilizers. Consequently, farmers need access to information on factors influencing economic returns of fertilizer use in order to make the right decisions.},

abstract = {Methods to construct farm household typologies may differ in their approach but they share a common feature: they rely mostly on structural farm data. Methods to build functional typologies are far less abundant. Households or communities are complex social-ecological systems that often exhibit patterns in their response to disturbances (e.g., droughts, floods, price shocks, policy change). We propose building functional typologies – classifiable ´behaviours´ of rural actors – using archetype analysis to categorise such responses and identify salient behaviours. We illustrate this approach by examining the response of rural households to recurrent droughts in northern Patagonia, Argentina, as revealed by 23 in-depth interviews about perceptions and strategies concerning droughts. Using the algorithm from M{\o}rup and Hansen (2012), and the corrected Akaike decision rule, we identified three archetypes (A–C) that represented three distinct aggregated responses of households to droughts. Archetype A presented variable degrees of resistance to droughts (production losses {\textless} 40{\%}), avoidance and diversification, whereas archetype B exhibited tolerance (higher losses) and some degree of transformability (off-farm income). Archetype C farms exhibited high levels of vulnerability, if some degree of tolerance to high losses, but no real adaptive strategy to speak of. Such pattern could not have been identified through the more commonly used typology building methods such as using multivariate and clustering techniques. By allowing to combine qualitative and quantitative information, and to deal with a relatively small number of observations, archetype analysis appears as highly suitable to delineate functional farm household typologies.},

But how can these global generalizations be used for evidence-based decision making at the local scale, if only the local evidence is perceived to be relevant to a local decision? We show how an interactive method of meta-analysis — dynamic meta-analysis — can be used to assess the local relevance of global evidence. We developed Metadataset (www.metadataset.com) as an example of dynamic meta-analysis. Using Metadataset, we show how evidence can be filtered and weighted, and results can be recalculated, using dynamic methods of subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and recalibration. With an example from agroecology, we show how dynamic meta-analysis could lead to different conclusions for different subsets of the global evidence. Dynamic meta-analysis could also lead to a rebalancing of power and responsibility in evidence synthesis, since evidence users would be able to make decisions that are typically made by systematic reviewers — decisions about which studies to include (e.g., critical appraisal) and how to handle missing or poorly reported data (e.g., sensitivity analysis). We suggest that dynamic meta-analysis could be scaled up and used for subject-wide evidence synthesis in several scientific disciplines (e.g., agroecology and conservation biology). However, the metadata that are used to filter and weight the evidence would need to be standardized within disciplines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Different fields within a farm have been observed to have different soil fertility status and this may affect the response of a maize crop to applied N, P, and K fertiliser. A limiting nutrient trial was carried out at six farms each, in three districts of Western Kenya. In each of the farms, the following treatments were laid out in three fields with different soil fertility status at different distances from the homestead (close, mid-distance, remote fields): no inputs, application of NPK, NP, NK, or PK fertiliser (urea, triple super phosphate, KCl) to maize. Total soil N decreased at all sites with distance to the homestead (from 1.30 to 1.06 g kg-1), as did Olsen-P (from 10.5 to 2.3 mg kg-1). Grain yields in the no-input control plots reflected this decrease in soil fertility status with distance to the homestead (from 2.59 to 1.59 t ha-1). In the NPK treatments, however, this difference between field types disappeared (from 3.43 to 3.98 t ha-1), indicating that N and P are the major limiting nutrients in the target areas. Response to applied N was related to the soil total N content in Aludeka and Shinyalu, but not in Emuhaia, probably related to the high use of partially decomposed organic inputs with limited N availability. Consequently, response to applied N decreased with distance to the homestead in Aludeka (from 0.95 kg kg-1 relative yield to 0.55 kg kg-1) and Shinyalu (from 0.76 kg kg-1 to 0.47 kg kg-1), but not in Emuhaia (from 0.75 kg kg-1 to 0.68 kg kg-1). Response to applied P was related to the soil Olsen-P content at all sites. While for farms with a relatively high Olsen-P gradient, response to applied P decreased with distance to the homestead (from 0.99 kg kg-1 to 0.68 kg kg-1), large variability in Olsen-P gradients across field types among farms within a specific site often masked clear differences in response to P between field types for a specific site. Clear scope for field-specific fertiliser recommendations exists, provided these are based on local soil knowledge and diagnosis. Scenario analysis, using farm-scale modelling tools, could assist in determining optimum allocation strategies of scarcely available fertiliser for maximum fertiliser use efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer.},

abstract = {Forest vulnerability to drought is expected to increase under anthropogenic climate change, and drought-induced mortality and community dynamics following drought have major ecological and societal impacts. Here,we showthat tree mortality concomitant with drought has led to short-term (mean 5 y, range 1 to 23 y after mortality) vegetation-type conversion in multiple biomes across the world (131 sites). Self-replacement of the dominant tree species was only prevalent in 21{\%} of the examined cases and forests and woodlands shifted to nonwoody vegetation in 10{\%} of them. The ultimate temporal persistence of such changes remains unknown but, given the key role of biological legacies in long-term ecological succession, this emerging picture of postdrought ecological trajectories highlights the potential for major ecosystem reorganization in the coming decades. Community changes were less pronounced under wetter postmortality conditions. Replacement was also influenced by management intensity, and postdrought shrub dominance was higher when pathogens acted as codrivers of tree mortality. Early change in community composition indicates that forests dominated by mesic species generally shifted toward more xeric communities, with replacing tree and shrub species exhibiting drier bioclimatic optima and distribution ranges. However, shifts toward more mesic communities also occurred and multiple pathways of forest replacement were observed for some species. Drought characteristics, species-specific environmental preferences, plant traits, and ecosystem legacies govern postdrought species turnover and subsequent ecological trajectories, with potential far-reaching implications for forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {The processes of nutrient depletion and soil degradation that limit productivity of smallholder African farms are spatially heterogeneous. Causes of variability in soil fertility management at different scales of analysis are both biophysical and socio-economic. Such heterogeneity is categorised in this study, which quantifies its impact on nutrient flows and soil fertility status at region and farm scales, as a first step in identifying spatial and temporal niches for targeting of soil fertility management strategies and technologies. Transects for soil profile observation, participatory rural appraisal techniques and classical soil sampling and chemical analysis were sampled across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka), which together represent much of the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Five representative farm types were identified using socio-economic information and considering production activities, household objectives and the main constraints faced by farmers. Soil fertility management and nutrient resource flows were studied for each farm type and related to differences in soil fertility status at farm scale. Farm types 1 and 2 were the wealthiest; the former relied on off-farm income and farmed small pieces of land (0.6-1.1 ha) while the latter farmed relatively large land areas (1.6-3.8 ha) mainly with cash crops. The poorest farm type 5 also farmed small pieces of land (0.4-1.0 ha) but relied on low wages derived from working for wealthier farmers. Both farm types 1 and 5 relied on off-farm earnings and sold the least amounts of farm produce to the market, though the magnitude of their cash, labour and nutrient flows was contrasting. Farms of types 3 and 4 were intermediate in size and wealth, and represented different crop production strategies for self-consumption and the market. Average grain yields fluctuated around 1 t ha-1 year -1 for all farm types and sub-locations. Grain production by farms of types 4 and 5 was much below annual family requirements, estimated at 170 kg person-1 year-1. Household wealth and production orientation affected the pattern of resource flow at farm scale. In the land-constrained farms of type 1, mineral fertilisers were often used more intensively (ca. 50 kg ha-1), though with varying application rates (14-92 kg ha-1). The use of animal manure in such small farms (e.g. 2.2 t year-1) represented intensities of use of up to 8 t ha -1, and a net accumulation of C and macronutrients brought into the farm by livestock. In farms of type 5, intensities of use of mineral and organic fertilisers ranged between 0-12 kg ha-1 and 0-0.5 t ha-1, respectively. A consistent trend of decreasing input use from farm types 1-5 was generally observed, but nutrient resources and land management practices (e.g. fallow) differed enormously between sub-locations. Inputs of nutrients were almost nil in Aludeka farms. Both inherent soil properties and management explained the variability found in soil fertility status. Texture explained the variation observed in soil C and related total N between sub-locations, whereas P availability varied mainly between farm types as affected by input use. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of farm level surveys from 1992 and 2002 indicates slight increases in the use of improved maize varieties and fertilizer, but a substantial decrease in the intensity of fertilizer use. The econometric analysis suggests that the intensity of fertilizer use has a major effect on yield. The use of improved maize varieties, however, did not affect yield, suggesting that there are local varieties for some areas that do as well as improved varieties. Research is needed to develop improved varieties for some areas, and also needed for the development of alternative affordable soil fertility measures},

abstract = {Agricultural production in Northern Ghana is dominated by smallholder farm systems, which are characterized by low inputs and low outputs, declining soil fertility, large yield gaps and limited adoption of agricultural technologies. There is an urgent need for alternative farm designs that are more productive, yet more sustainable. Technology packages for sustainable intensification are promoted by an R4D project in the Upper East, Upper West and Northern Regions of Ghana. In this paper, we analyse differences in perceived suitability, and modelled technical impact per technology package. We used a locally validated framework to categorise farm systems diversity that considers both, the horizontal (between households) and vertical (within households) dimension of diversity. Farm households were classified along a gradient of resource endowment. We selected one representative farm per type and per region to assess and compare their socio-economic and environmental performance (farm profitability, labour and soil organic matter inputs) using the whole-farm model Farm DESIGN. We then used Farm DESIGN to assess the potential impact of five proposed technology packages and to explore promising alternative farm configurations. We discussed model assumptions and results with farmers, including alternative cropping patterns and trade-offs. We evaluated the packages with different household members using a weighted scoring technique, subsequently juxtaposing model results with farmer perceptions. Large differences prevailed among and within farms per type and per region, with low resource endowed farms being projected to benefit most in relative and least in absolute terms from an adoption of the packages. Farmer feedback confirmed the accuracy of alternative farm configurations, as determined by the model. However, the feedback also revealed that the most profitable farm designs would be hard to attain in reality, particularly for members of low and medium resource endowed households, due to high initial investment costs. Within households, women were more positive about the packages than men, since men heavily penalized extra costs and labour, translating into a greater congruence of model results with the male evaluation. We discuss the importance of distinguishing between technical (technology i.e. purchased tools and inputs) and managerial (techniques e.g. row planting) package components. We conclude that operationalizing inter- and intra-household diversity is a fundamental step in identifying sensible solutions for the challenges smallholder farm systems face in Northern Ghana.},

abstract = {Soil is one of the most important natural resources and medium for plant growth. Anthropogenic interventions such as tillage, irrigation, and fertilizer application can affect the health of the soil. Use of fertilizer nitrogen (N) for crop production influences soil health primarily through changes in organic matter content, microbial life, and acidity in the soil. Soil organic matter (SOM) constitutes the storehouse of soil N. Studies with 15N-labelled fertilizers show that in a cropping season, plants take more N from the soil than from the fertilizer. A large number of long-term field experiments prove that optimum fertilizer N application to crops neither resulted in loss of organic matter nor adversely affected microbial activity in the soil. Fertilizer N, when applied at or below the level at which maximum yields are achieved, resulted in the build-up of SOM and microbial biomass by promoting plant growth and increasing the amount of litter and root biomass added to soil. Only when fertilizer N was applied at rates more than the optimum, increased residual inorganic N accelerated the loss of SOM through its mineralization. Soil microbial life was also adversely affected at very high fertilizers rates. Optimum fertilizer use on agricultural crops reduces soil erosion but repeated application of high fertilizer N doses may lead to soil acidity, a negative soil health trait. Site-specific management strategies based on principles of synchronization of N demand by crops with N supply from all sources including soil and fertilizer could ensure high yields, along with maintenance of soil health. Balanced application of different nutrients and integrated nutrient management based on organic manures and mineral fertilizers also contributed to soil health maintenance and improvement. Thus, fertilizer N, when applied as per the need of the field crops in a balanced proportion with other nutrients and along with organic manures, if available with the farmer, maintains or improves soil health rather than being deleterious.},

abstract = {Conservation agriculture is widely promoted across sub-Saharan Africa as a sustainable farming practice that enhances adaptive capacity to climate change. The interactions between climate stress, management, and soil are critical to understanding the adaptive capacity of conservation agriculture. Yet conservation agriculture syntheses to date have largely neglected climate, especially the effects of extreme heat. For the sub-tropics and tropics, we use meta-regression, in combination with global soil and climate datasets, to test four hypotheses: (1) that relative yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought and temperature stress; (2) that the effects of moisture and temperature stress exposure interact; (3) that the effects of moisture and temperature stress are modified by soil texture; and (4) that crop diversification, fertilizer application rate, or the time since no-till implementation will enhance conservation agriculture performance under climate stress. Our results support the hypothesis that the relative maize yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought severity or exposure to high temperatures. Further, there is an interaction of moisture and heat stress on conservation agriculture performance and their combined effect is both non-additive and modified by soil clay content, supporting our second and third hypotheses. Finally, we found only limited support for our fourth hypothesis as (1) increasing nitrogen application rates did not improve the relative performance of conservation agriculture under high heat stress; (2) crop diversification did not notably improve conservation agriculture performance, but did increase its stability with heat stress; and (3) a statistically robust effect of the time since no-till implementation was not evident. Our meta-regression supports the narrative that conservation agriculture enhances the adaptive capacity of maize production in sub-Saharan Africa under drought and/or heat stress. However, in very wet seasons and on clay-rich soils, conservation agriculture yields less compared to conventional practices.},

abstract = {This paper examines the contribution of digitalization to economic growth of Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) in comparison with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies. The main reason for comparing the most and the least developed countries to measure the effects of digitalization is to have an insight of whether such effects depend on the levels of development of the country. New technologies in Sub Saharan Africa are assumed to have played significant roles in economic activity, including accessibility of communications, which was impeded by poor infrastructure, accommodation of the poor majority who were initially financially excluded from mobile banking and participation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in e-commerce. On the other hand, due to the effects of digitalization, least developed countries in SSA have been facing a premature deindustrialization. This study employs a panel dataset consisting of 11 years from 2006 to 2016 for 41 SSA and 33 OECD economies and we use the generalized linear methods of moments (GMM) estimators. The results show that digitalization has a positive contribution to economic growth in both groups of countries. The effect of broadband internet is minimal for SSA compared to OECD countries, whereas the impact of mobile telecommunications is higher in SSA compared to the OECD counterpart. These results are particularly interesting as less advanced technologies create more opportunities in the least developed countries since there is more space for improvement. With respect to policy implications, this study recommends that SSA governments should invest more in ICT along with other infrastructures, so as to benefit from digitalization and to realize significant economic growth.},

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important food crop in western Kenya, mostly grown by smallholder farmers in complex and risky cropping systems. Trends in population growth in the country indicate that the demand for maize is projected to increase 3-4{\%} annually. Production is however hampered by the predominance of fragile ecosystems (acidic soils), low soil fertility and low use of chemical inputs. The average grain yield is less than 1.0 t ha-1 instead of a reachable 5.0 t ha-1, leading to vicious cycle of food insecurity. An on-farm experiment was conducted in two soil types (Alfisols and Ultisols) in Kakamega, western Kenya, between February and September 2007 to test effects of various organic inputs (Farmyard manure, Tithonia biomass and Desmodium cover crop) in combination with inorganic fertilizers (N, P, K, Mg, B and Zn) on yield of maize. The design was Randomized Complete Block Design, replicated 5 times and the data was subjected to ANOVA and DMRT tests. Soil analysis before planting indicated that pH was 5.0 and 5.4 in Alfisols and Ultisols, respectively. Both soils were deficient in N and P but adequate in exchangeable bases (K, Ca and Mg). Maize grain yield was higher in Ultisols compared to Alfisols. In Alfisols, organic inputs in combination with 30 kg N ha-1 gave maize grain yield improvement of nearly 100{\%} over farmer's practice (non improved maize variety, wider plant spacing, inorganic fertilizer applied at the rate of 20 N+20 P ha-1, one weeding). When inorganic fertilizer (60 kg N+60 kg P ha-1) was applied to maize/banana intercrop, maize yield increased by about 40{\%}. In contrast, in Ultisols, organic inputs increased maize grain yield by between 85{\%} and 115{\%}, while maize/banana intercrop (plus 60 kg N+60 kg P ha-1) increased maize grain yield by only 4{\%} over the farmer's practice. Banana intercrop reduced maize population resulting in low maize grain and stover yield. Use of either farmyard manure, tithonia biomass or desmonium cover crop in combination with 30 kg of N ha-1 (from inorganic source) can enhance maize production among smallholder farmers in acidic soils who ordinarily cannot afford to purchase adequate quantities of inorganic fertilizers.},

Improving access, especially in rural areas, requires useful measures of current access to the locations where these resources and opportunities are found. Recent work has developed a global map of travel times to cities with more than 50,000 people in the year 2015. However, the provision of resources and opportunities will differ across the broad spectrum of settlements that range from small towns to megacities, and access to this spectrum of settlement sizes should also be measured. Here we present a suite of nine global travel-time accessibility indicators for the year 2015, at approximately one-kilometre spatial resolution, for a range of settlement size classes. We validated the travel-time estimates against journey times from a Google driving directions application across 1,511 2° × 2° tiles representing 47,812 journeys. We observed very good agreement, though our estimates were more frequently shorter than those from the Google application with a median difference of −13.7 minutes and a median percentage difference of −16.9{\%}.},

abstract = {The core of many changes towards a more sustainable agriculture is the individual decision-maker. The decisions of each farmer have impacts on sustainability and are made in a complex world of contradictious interests and values. Agricultural decision support systems (AgriDSS) will be a major contributor in the realization of a viable farm economy with less nega-tive environmental impact, but it must not only provide current and relevant information. Current DSSs available to farmers, advisors, experts, and policy makers are not used to their full poten-tial. One reason is that they fail to capture the actual needs of the farmers and to understand their decision-making in practice. They are not adapted to the high complexity characterizing sustaina-ble land use decision-making. Among farmers the acceptance of these systems are low, partly because existing DSS are based on what scientists and system developers consider as necessary. As a result, new linkages and better understanding between different stakeholders in agriculture has to be improved. The user-centred design (UCD) approach can answer the core of the identi-fied problems of most DSSs, because it put the farmers' experience in focus and involve them early and continuously in the design process. In this paper we discuss next generation's AgriDSS which are useful and useable for farmers and other stakeholders. By introducing theories from UCD, illustrated by the Swedish case of imple-menting Precision Agriculture, we show what is needed to make new technologies contribute to resilient farms and farming systems. We argue that there is a dual link between environmental sustainability and information systems (IS) addressing both sustainability through design – how IS can be used to promote more sustainable behaviours, and sustainability in design – how sus-tainability can be the governing principle of the design of the information systems themselves. Consequently, the next generation's AgriDSS must simultaneously enable stakeholders to get access to the best knowledge available, and at the same time involve them in the process of de-veloping the user interface design. To use existing and future information efficiently, participa-tory approaches are therefore crucial and need to be a part of transition towards sustainable agri-culture.},

As the overall percentage of maize farmers growing hybrids tops 80{\%} and the seed industry matures, the slow pace of hybrid replacement on farms, and the continued dominance of the seed industry by Kenya Seed Company, may dampen productivity. Our econometric analysis identifies the factors that explain farmer demand for hybrid seed, and the age of hybrids they grow, considering hybrid seed ownership. Male-headed households with more education, more assets, and more land plant more hybrid seed. Scale of seed demand per farm is differentiated by agroecology. We find a strong farmer response to the seed-to-grain price ratio, which we interpret as evidence of a commercial orientation even on household farms. However, despite the dramatic increase in the number of hybrids sold and the breadth of seed suppliers as seed markets liberalize, an older hybrid still dominates national demand. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

abstract = {Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been widely promoted as an agro-ecological approach to sustainable production intensification. Despite numerous initiatives promoting CA across Sub-Saharan Africa there have been low rates of adoption. Furthermore, there has been strong debate concerning the ability of CA to provide benefits to smallholder farmers regarding yield, labour, soil quality and weeding, particularly where farmers are unable to access external inputs such as herbicides. This research finds evidence that CA, using no external inputs, is most attractive among the very poor and that farmers are driven primarily by strong motivational factors in the key areas of current contention, namely yield, labour, soil quality and weeding time benefits. This study is the first to incorporate a quantitative socio-psychological model to understand factors driving adoption of CA. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), it explores farmers' intention to use CA (within the next 12 months) in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique where CA has been promoted for almost a decade. The study site provides a rich population from which to examine farmers' decision making in using CA. Regression estimates show that the TPB provides a valid model of explaining farmers' intention to use CA accounting for 80{\%} of the variation in intention. Farmers' attitude is found to be the strongest predictor of intention. This is mediated through key cognitive drivers present that influence farmers' attitude such as increased yields, reduction in labour, improvement in soil quality and reduction in weeds. Subjective norm (i.e. social pressure from referents) and perceived behavioural control also significantly influenced farmers' intention. Furthermore, path analysis identifies farmers that are members of a Farmer Field School or participants of other organisations (e.g. savings group, seed multiplication group or a specific crop/livestock association) have a significantly stronger positive attitude towards CA with the poorest the most likely users and the cohort that find it the easiest to use. This study provides improved understanding relevant to many developing countries, of smallholder farmers' adoption dynamics related to CA, and of how farmers may approach this and other 'new' management systems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS). RAAIS is a diagnostic tool that can guide the analysis of complex agricultural problems and innovation capacity of the agricultural system in which the complex agricultural problem is embedded. RAAIS focuses on the integrated analysis of different dimensions of problems (e.g. biophysical, technological, socio-cultural, economic, institutional and political), interactions across different levels (e.g. national, regional, local), and the constraints and interests of different stakeholder groups (farmers, government, researchers, etc.). Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system. RAAIS combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide specific entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of RAAIS to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.},

abstract = {The fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) estimated that by 2040 agroforestry would offer high potential of carbon (C) sequestration in developing countries. However, the role of tropical agroforestry in C sequestration and in climate change mitigation has only recently been recognized by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is partly due to the lack of reliable estimates on the sequestration potential in biomass and soil carbon pools over time. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in the biomass and soil carbon pools of three indigenous agroforestry systems in south-eastern Rift Valley escrapment of Ethiopia using CO2FIX (v. 3.2) model. The agroforestry systems studied were Enset (Ensete ventricosum)-tree, Enset-coffee-tree, and Tree-coffee systems. To run the model, empirical data collected from 60 farms (20 farms for each agroforestry system) and literature were used as inputs to parameterize the model. Simulations were run over a period of 50 years. Average simulated total biomass C stocks was the highest for Tree-coffee system (122Mg Cha-1), followed by the Enset-coffee-tree (114Mg Cha-1) and Enset-tree system (76Mg Cha-1). The tree cohort accounted for 89-97{\%} of the total biomass C stocks in all the studied systems, and the reminder was shared by Enset and coffee cohorts. The total average simulated total C stocks (biomass and soil) were 209, 286 and 301Mg Cha-1 for Enset-tree, Enset-coffee-tree and Tree-coffee systems, respectively. The soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks accounted for 60-64{\%} of the total carbon in the studied systems. Model validation results showed that long-term (10-40 years) simulated biomass C stocks were within the range of measured biomass C stocks for Enset-tree and Enset-coffee-tree systems, but significantly differed for the Tree-coffee system. The simulated soil and total C stocks were within the range of measured values for all the three systems. The CO2FIX model accurately predicted the SOC and total C stocks in the studied indigenous agroforestry systems, but the prediction of the biomass C stocks could be improved by acquiring more accurate input parameter values for running the model.},

Results indicated that the species' present potential distribution range was mainly found in the Sudanian and Sudano-Guinean ecological regions. Some extensions and retractions of the present-day distribution (lowly, moderately and highly suitable habitats) were noted under future climates based on the two scenarios. Introduction of D. microcarpum in suitable habitats are required for its efficient conservation in West Africa.},

abstract = {The 'push-pull' technology is a novel pest management strategy developed for control of stemborers and striga weed, Striga hermonthica, in maize-based farming systems in eastern Africa, where maize is intercropped with desmodium, a forage legume, and Napier grass is planted as a border crop. Desmodium repels stemborer moths while Napier grass attracts them. Desmodium also suppresses the parasitic striga weed through a series of mechanisms ranging from shading to allelopathy through the root system. The technology is currently being disseminated among smallholder farmers in eastern Africa and adoption rates are rising. Our on-station studies have reported efficacy of this technology against the two pests resulting in increased grain yields. The current study was conducted between 2003 and 2006 in 14 districts in western Kenya to assess effectiveness of the technology under farmers' own conditions. Twenty farmers from each district, who had adopted the technology, were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a 'push-pull' and a maize monocrop. Seasonal data were collected on percentage of maize plants damaged by stemborers, the number of emerged striga, plant height and grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions on the benefits of the technology were assessed using a structured questionnaire. Stemborer damage and striga counts to maize plants were significantly lower in the 'push-pull' plots than in the maize monocrop plots. Similarly, maize plant height and grain yields were significantly higher in the former. Farmers rated the 'push-pull' technology significantly superior in having reduced stemborers and striga infestation rates and increased soil fertility and grain yields. These results demonstrate that the technology is equally effective in controlling both pests with concomitant yield increases under farmers' conditions in the districts studied. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Between October 1988 and August 1992, field experiments were carried out in West Kenya to evaluate the suitability of Leucaena leucocephala, L. collinsii, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus, Sesbania sesban, S. grandiflora, Senna siamea and S. spectabilis to provide a range of agroforestry products and services. The initial objective was to establish the growth rates and wood and leaf yields of these tree species, when planted in single rows. After the initial evaluation, it was evident that valuable additional information could be collected if the trees were converted to hedges and their effect on intercropped maize and soils was studied. At 21 months after planting, different species and provenances ranged in height between 3.5 and 6 m and varied considerably in phenotypic appearance. Wood production (1988-1990) varied from 3 to 33.8 t ha-1 and leaf production varied from 0.62 to 10.1 t ha-1. During intercropping (1990-1992), leaf production varied from 0 to 10.9 t ha-1. Maize yields were higher in association with Leucaena and Gliricidia than with Calliandra, Sesbania and Senna. Cumulative maize grain and stover yields over four seasons were positively correlated with the total amount of tree leaves applied (r2 range, 0.70-0.95). The effect of tree leaf mulch on crop yields decreased over time for all species. Leaves with high nutrient contents, which decompose fast (Leucaena, Gliricidia, Sesbania) are likely to have been more effective in sustaining crop yields than leaves with lower nutrient contents (Senna) or more complex decomposition patterns (Calliandra). Simple 'leaf input-crop output' budgets to calculate the reserves for N, P and K in different systems explained crop yield differences in some cases. Compared to the fertility status of 'zero-mulch' control plots, the status of soil C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S was to varying degrees improved under Leucaena, Gliricidia and Sesbania, much less under Calliandra but not under Senna. First season grain yields were related to the soil fertility status at the end of the tree fallow. The results of these experiments suggest that under subhumid tropical conditions with soils of relatively poor nutrient status, where light and water are not likely to be the major limiting factors to crop production, the application of sufficient quantities of high quality tree mulch may positively influence maize yields. When agroforestry tree species with contrasting decomposition and nutrient release patterns are evaluated jointly, it is more difficult to demonstrate a general relationship between quantities of mulch applied and improvements in crop yields and soil fertility levels. Therefore, further chemical, physiological and phenotypic characterization of tree species with potential for fallow and intercropping systems is required.},

abstract = {Mixed family farms produce almost half of the world food. Increasing food supply in developing countries requires increasing productivity of both land and farmers' labour as key to increase household income, food security and reduce poverty. A research project developed into Uruguayan vegetable family farms (2006–2010) revealed that the main life quality problems were low family income, high work overload, lack of leisure time, and health problems associated with work. In many of these farms, labour productivity was lower than the opportunity cost of labour. Understanding labour productivity determinants would help to guide co-innovation processes of family farm systems. The objective of this study was to develop and apply a method to analyze labour productivity (LP) at farm level, identifying the main causes of low LP, to use its results in a co-innovation process. We selected 14 vegetable-beef cattle farms with different resource endowment. The method developed involved characterization and quantification of labour allocation to farm activities, calculation of technical coefficients that explained LP and quantification of improvement scenarios. The first scenario estimated the impact of farm redesign plans and the second one added the effect of mechanizing some tasks. LP was lower than the opportunity cost of labour (4 USD h−1) in 10 out of 14 farms. LP in vegetable production (LPv) was explained by both, net return (NR, {\$} kg−1) and labour efficiency (LE, kg h−1). LE correlated with the amount of product sold (APS, kg of vegetables or meet per year). LP in beef cattle production (LPb) was lower than LPv. LPb was higher on farms with more than 80 cattle units (CU) and 60 ha due to lower labour per ha and per CU showing a scale effect. Projected scenarios showed that LP could be tripled by improving resource allocation, and crop and animals management. Mechanizing some labour consuming tasks could further increase LP by 12 {\%}. This study contributes to co-innovation methodology development by adding labour productivity analysis at diagnosis stage and using the results to aid participatory development of applicable and appropriate strategies to increase family farm systems sustainability.},

abstract = {Accurate spatial information of agricultural fields in smallholder farms is important for providing actionable information to farmers, managers, and policymakers. Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images can capture such information. However, the automated delineation of fields in smallholder farms is a challenging task because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems, which make their boundaries vaguely defined. Physical edges between smallholder fields are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours need to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural pattern between fields. In these circumstances, standard edge-detection algorithms fail to extract accurate boundaries. This article introduces a strategy to detect field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalisation and grouping algorithm. The convolutional network using an encoder-decoder structure is capable of learning complex spatial-contextual features from the image and accurately detects sparse field contours. A hierarchical segmentation is derived from the contours using the oriented watershed transform and by iteratively merging adjacent regions based on the average strength of their common boundary. Finally, field segments are obtained by adopting a combinatorial grouping algorithm exploiting the information of the segmentation hierarchy. An extensive experimental analysis is performed in two study areas in Nigeria and Mali using WorldView-2/3 images and comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on the precision-recall accuracy assessment strategy which is tolerating small localisation errors in the detected contours. The proposed strategy shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with F-scores higher than 0.7 and 0.6 on our two test areas, respectively, outperforming alternative techniques.},

abstract = {This chapter addresses how indigenous agroforestry systems relate to, and can be adapted for, integrative landscape management strategies and sustainable supply chain development. We begin by describing the role of indigenous agroforestry and human activities more generally in the history of Amazonian landscapes. We argue based on this discussion that indigenous land use practices, such as agroforestry, should be more strongly supported by governmental and non-governmental entities. Next, we explain why agroforestry has started to receive greater attention in recent years and describe the context of Napo, Ecuador, a region in the Upper Amazon that has been characterized in recent decades by in-migration, urbanization, and greater market integration. These processes have been both accompanied and facilitated by infrastructure development and the expansion of government services to rural communities. In the following section, we describe the Amazonian Kichwa agroforestry, or ‘chakra' system, and its role in overall landscape management. Next, we discuss the potential of guayusa (Ilex guayusa) commercialization to serve as a promising example of integrating agroforestry with sustainable supply chains. Then, we analyze the possibilities of building new supply chains based on agroforestry and other forest products and describe some of the challenges associated with applying the guayusa commercialization model to other species. Finally, we discuss efforts to better integrate agroforestry management into a variety of other landscape management practices. We conclude with a series of policy suggestions for building sustainable supply chains for agroforestry and other forest products and integrating agroforestry with robust landscape management strategies.},

The mean herd size was 2.46, while a proportion of 36.4{\%} and 15{\%} of the animals were lactating cows and heifers respectively. The mean milk yield /cow/day was 6.47 litres with 89.3{\%} of the farms producing less than 10 litres of milk/cow/day. Average quantity of milk produced was 1168 litres/cow/year. Mean lactation length was 7.67 months (230 days) with majority of farms (77.8{\%}) recording a lactation period of 5-7 months (150-210 days). The mean calving interval was 14.77 months (430 days) with a range of 12-36, while mean age at first calving was 28.16 months with a range of 24-38 months. 98{\%} of the farms used Napier grass as the main fodder. The study concluded that the low performance of dairy herds in the region may be attributed to type of breeds kept, low numbers of lactating cows and replacement heifers, short lactation period and utilization of low quality feed resources. It is recommended that management skills, strong institutional linkages, support for commercial rearing of dairy breeding stock, and feeds diversification programme should be developed to improve performance of dairy herds in the region.},

abstract = {Agroforestry, the inclusion of woody perennials within farming systems, has been widespread throughout the tropics as a traditional land use developed by subsistence farmers and, more recently, as an important livelihoods' option promoted by land-use managers and international development agencies. Agroforestry systems range from subsistence livestock and pastoral systems to home gardens, alley intercropping, and biomass plantations with a wide diversity of biophysical conditions and socio-ecological characteristics. A quantification of the extent of agroforestry globally was first attempted by the World Agroforestry Center in 2009 in order to address the widely varying estimates about its importance. Since then, the global remote sensing dataset upon which that estimate was based has been updated, both with improved quality and now including annual datasets available for 11 years (2000–2010). The geospatial analysis of remote sensing-derived global datasets conducted in 2009 investigated the correspondence and relationship of tree cover, population density and climatic conditions within agricultural land at 1 km resolution. This has now been reanalyzed based on the improved data, along with an investigation of change trends from the years 2000 (averaged 2000–2002) to 2010 (averaged 2008–2010). Among the key results are that 1) agroforestry appears to increase globally both in extent and in number of people associated with it; 2) remains a significant feature of agriculture in all regions; 3) that its extent varies significantly across different regions (for example, more widespread in Central America and less in East Asia); 4) that tree cover is strongly positively related to humidity; and that 5) there are mixed relationships between tree cover and population density depending on the region. Agroforestry, if defined by tree cover on agricultural land of greater than 10{\%}, is widespread: found on more that 43{\%} of all agricultural land globally, where 30{\%} of rural populations live. Based on our current analysis, this land-use type represents over 1 billion hectares of land and more than 900 million people. Agroforestry is particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia, Central America, and South America with over 50{\%} of area under agroforestry. Globally, the amount of tree cover on agricultural land increased substantially in the decade under investigation, with the area of {\textgreater}10{\%} tree cover increasing 3{\%}, or more than 828 000 km2. South America showed the largest increase in area with {\textgreater}10{\%} tree cover: more than 489 000 km2: an increase of 12.6{\%}. South Asia also showed a large increase (6.7{\%}), along with East Asia (5{\%}), Oceania (3.2{\%}) and Southeast Asia (2.7{\%}). In Central America, the area with {\textgreater}10{\%} tree cover increased by 1.6{\%} to become 96{\%} of all agricultural land. For Sub-Saharan Africa, we found an increase of 2{\%}. Only Northern and Central Asia showed a decrease: - 2.9{\%}. Tree cover apparently is still on the increase as a common feature on agricultural land throughout the world. It is essential that this is recognized by all involved in agricultural production, planning and policy development.},

abstract = {Agriculture and the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are highly sensitive to climatic variability. Drought, in particular, represents one of the most important natural factors contributing to malnutrition and famine in many parts of the region. The overall impact of drought on a given country/region and its ability to recover from the resulting social, economic and environmental impacts depends on several factors. The economic, social and environmental impacts of drought are huge in SSA and the national costs and losses incurred threaten to undermine the wider economic and development gains made in the last few decades in the region. There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of countries to climate variability and to the threats posed by climate change. This paper attempts to highlight the challenges of drought in SSA and reviews the current drought risk management strategies, especially the promising technological and policy options for managing drought risks to protect livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. The review suggests the possibilities of several ex ante and ex post drought management strategies in SSA although their effectiveness depends on agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Existing technological, policy and institutional risk management measures need to be strengthened and integrated to manage drought ex ante and to minimize the ex post negative effects for vulnerable households and regions. A proactive approach that combines promising technological, institutional and policy solutions to manage the risks within vulnerable communities implemented by institutions operating at different levels (community, sub-national, and national) is considered to be the way forward for managing drought and climate variability. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

The projected yields of crops under a range of agricultural and climatic scenarios are needed to assess food security prospects. Previous meta-analyses have summarized climate change impacts and adaptive potential as a function of temperature, but have not examined uncertainty, the timing of impacts, or the quantitative effectiveness of adaptation. Here we develop a new data set of more than 1,700 published simulations to evaluate yield impacts of climate change and adaptation. Without adaptation, losses in aggregate production are expected for wheat, rice and maize in both temperate and tropical regions by 2 °C of local warming. Crop-level adaptations increase simulated yields by an average of 7-15{\%}, with adaptations more effective for wheat and rice than maize. Yield losses are greater in magnitude for the second half of the century than for the first. Consensus on yield decreases in the second half of the century is stronger in tropical than temperate regions, yet even moderate warming may reduce temperate crop yields in many locations. Although less is known about interannual variability than mean yields, the available data indicate that increases in yield variability are likely.{\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Innovation in agronomy by large numbers of smallholder farmers will need to accelerate if global commitments to end hunger are to be achieved in the face of major climate and other global change that are both caused by, and impact, agriculture. Conventional research and development in agronomy have involved a research process that produces technologies, which are then promoted for uptake by large numbers of farmers through extension, with both research and extension phases being more or less participatory. Recent research, including key contributions to this special issue, reveals that the performance of many technology options varies hugely across the geographies over which development programmes operate, depending on social, economic and ecological context. This severely limits the value of attempting to produce recommendations for large areas and numbers of farmers and identifies the need for new ways of supporting innovation that address the real-world heterogeneity of farmer circumstances. Addressing this widespread phenomenon of option by context interaction (OxC) has profound implications for how agronomic research and development are organised. Papers in this special issue show the nature and implications of such interactions and suggest ways in which research and development systems need to respond in order to support locally relevant innovation. It is evident that a paradigm shift is well underway, with researchers embracing new modes of thinking and action required to address OxC interactions, but these also need to be taken up and further developed by extension and change agents in the public and private sector. It is only through continued co-development of methods involving both these constituencies, working closely with farmers that sufficient progress is likely to be made for smallholder farming to keep pace with global demand for food without further damaging the environmental resources upon which production is based.},

Developing resistant varieties has been identified as an important and environmentally friendly aspect of the integrated pest management system. However, little is known about the genetic control of resistance to the maize weevil. The objective of this research was to understand the genetic control and heritability of resistance to the maize weevil. Five parents were crossed in a complete diallel mating design to obtain 20 hybrids and five parental lines. The 25 genotypes were evaluated with two local checks to obtain their seeds. The seeds obtained from these genotypes were subsequently used in the laboratory evaluation for the identification and selection of maize genotypes with resistance to the maize weevil. The laboratory assessment identified parent TZEEQI 111 as the best parental line for resistance to the maize weevil. General Combining Ability (GCA) is the mean performance of a line, when expressed as a deviation from the mean of all crosses. There was highly significant and negative GCA effects for F1 weevil progeny emergence, percentage weight loss, and percentage grain damage and susceptibility index. Positive and significant GCA effect for median development period was also observed. Heritability estimates revealed high narrow sense heritability for F1 weevil progeny emergence, percentage grain damage and susceptibility index. These results suggest the presence of additive and non-additive gene action in the control of resistance to the maize weevil. Parental lines TZEEQI 111, TZEEQI 139 and TZEEQI 66 were the promising genotypes and can selected for breeding programs for developing genotypes with good agronomic traits.},

abstract = {To guide soil fertility investment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, better understanding is needed of the relative importance of soil and crop management factors in determining smallholder crop yields and yield variability. Spatial variability in crop yields within farms is strongly influenced by variation in both current crop management (e.g. planting dates, fertilizer rates) and soil fertility. Variability in soil fertility is in turn strongly influenced by farmers' past soil and crop management. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of soil fertility and crop management factors in determining yield variability and the gap between farmers' maize yields and potential yields in western Kenya. Soil fertility status was assessed on 522 farmers' fields on 60 farms and paired with data on maize-yield and agronomic management for a sub-sample 159 fields. Soil samples were analysed by wet chemistry methods (1/3 of the samples) and also by near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (all samples). Spectral prediction models for different soil indicators were developed to estimate soil properties for the 2/3 of the samples not analysed by wet chemistry. Because of the complexity of the data set, classification and regression trees (CART) were used to relate crop yields to soil and management factors. Maize grain yields for fields of different soil fertility status as classified by farmers were: poor, 0.5-1.1; medium, 1.0-1.8; high, 1.4-2.5 t ha-1. The CART analysis showed resource use intensity, planting date, and time of planting were the principal variables determining yield, but at low resource intensity, total soil N and soil Olsen P became important yield-determining factors. Only a small group of plots with high average grain yields (2.5 t ha-1; n = 8) was associated with use of nutrient inputs and good plant stands, whereas the largest group with low average yields (1.2 t ha-1; n = 90) was associated with soil Olsen P values of less than 4 mg kg-1. This classification could be useful as a basis for targeting agronomic advice and inputs to farmers. The results suggest that soil fertility variability patterns on smallholder farms are reinforced by farmers investing more resources on already fertile fields than on infertile fields. CART proved a useful tool for simplifying analysis and providing robust models linking yield to heterogeneous crop management and soil variables. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), maize production is not only constrained by the limited use of P fertilisers, but also by the strong P fixation (on Fe- and Al-oxides) which consequently lowers the amount of bioavailable P in the soil solution. We hypothesise that substitution of triple super phosphate (TSP) fertiliser with farmyard manure (FYM) and its localised application in the planting row increases the agronomic use efficiency (AE) of the P fertiliser applied. Field experiments were conducted during the 2009 long rains (LRs) and short rains (SRs) at three sites (Sega, Bokoli and Teso) located in western Kenya, to assess (i) the effect of concentrating FYM in different areas of the planting rows, (ii) FYM and TSP applications at different substitution rates and (iii) the effect of FYM and TSP additions and/or their combinations on soil pH, available P, maize yields, AE and economic benefits. Treatments included substituting TSP by FYM at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100{\%} of the 26kgPha-1 recommended rate. Further, 13kgPha-1 FYM was either applied to 100{\%} of planting area (i.e. broadcast) or localised in only 50{\%} or 25{\%}, of the planting area of the maize row. Results show that FYM and TSP combinations increased maize grain yields by over 200{\%} in Sega, 90-150{\%} in Teso and 20-50{\%} in Bokoli relative to the control. The AE largely depended on the relative fertility of the soils but increased with an increase in FYM in the substitutions. Soil pH and available P were improved by FYM applications only in the second season (2009 SRs). Maximising P from FYM in the substitutions increased net benefits by over 33{\%} with gross benefit cost ratios{\textgreater}4.5{\$}{\$}-1 relative to sole TSP application at 26kgPha-1. Concentrating FYM in 25{\%} of the planting area gave over 32{\%} increases in net benefits relative to broadcast. This study confirms that it is possible to reduce the quantity of FYM if it is applied only in the planting row but its profitability largely depends on the quality of the material selected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The East African region exhibits considerable climatic and topographic variability. Much spatial and temporal variation in the response of different crops to climate change can thus be anticipated. In previous work we showed that a large part of this variation can be explained in terms of temperature and, to a lesser extent, water effects. Here, we summarise simulated yield response in two crops that are widely grown in the region, maize and beans, and investigate how the impacts of climate change might be addressed at two levels: the agricultural system and the household. Regionally, there are substantial between-country and within-system differences in maize and bean production responses projected to 2050. The arid-semiarid mixed crop-livestock systems are projected to see reductions in maize and bean production throughout most of the region to 2050. Yields of these crops in the tropical highland mixed systems are projected to increase, sometimes substantially. The humid-subhumid mixed systems show more varied yield responses through time and across space. Some within-country shifts in cropping away from the arid-semiarid systems to cooler, higher-elevation locations may be possible, but increased regional trade should be able to overcome the country-level production deficits in maize and beans caused by climate change to 2050, all other things being equal. For some places in the tropical highlands, maize and bean yield increases could have beneficial effects on household food security and income levels. In the other mixed systems, moderate yield losses can be expected to be offset by crop breeding and agronomic approaches in the coming decades, while more severe yield losses may necessitate changes in crop types, movement to more livestock-orientated production, or abandonment of cropping altogether. These production responses are indicative only, and their effects will be under-estimated because the methods used here have not accounted for increasing weather variability in the future or changes in the distribution and impacts of biotic and other abiotic stresses. These system-level shifts will take place in a context characterised by high population growth rates; the demand for food is projected to nearly triple by the middle of this century. Systems will have to intensify substantially in response, particularly in the better-endowed mixed systems in the region. For the more marginal areas, the variability in yield response, and the variability in households' ability to adapt, suggest that, even given the limitations of this analysis, adaptation options need to be assessed at the level of the household and the local community, if research for development is to meet its poverty alleviation and food security targets in the face of global change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The availability of mobile technology among a large portion of the population has created an opportunity to deploy mobile-based services among small holder farmers. These platforms have been deployed in different areas of the country targeting small holder farmers practicing various forms of agriculture including crop and livestock farming. These services range from agriculture advisory information, record keeping, diagnosis services, market information and veterinary services among others. These services are availed on a range of mobile devices including basic phones, feature phones, smart phones and other hand-held computing devices. Different technologies have been used to develop these innovations such as SMS, USSD, IVR, mobile web and downloadable apps. We set out to establish the uptake and use of mAgriculture among the small holder farmers through FGDs and interviews with small farm holder farmers with a diverse and representative sample. Here we report our findings. We identified the challenges and lessons learnt at different stages of their implementation. It was discovered that only a few of these implementations have been widely adopted, as various challenges have hampered their growth beyond the pilot stage. However, some of the mAgriculture innovations have been successful and offer key lessons that other stakeholders should adopt for similar attempts.},

abstract = {The widespread growth of information and telecommunication technologies (ICTs) in rural areas of developing countries offers new opportunities to provide more timely and low-cost information services to farmers, as well as assist in coordinating agricultural agents. Over the past decade, the number of public and private sector initiatives in this space has increased substantially, with over 140 deployments worldwide in 2015. While there is substantial potential for such services to address farmers' and traders' information and credit market constraints, economic research suggests that the impacts of such services on agricultural adoption, behavior and welfare is mixed. While this can, in part, be explained by the degree of the information asymmetry and the presence of other market failures in different contexts, research from other disciplines provides additional insights into these findings. In particular, work in the domain of human–computer interaction (HCI) focuses heavily on users' interaction and experience with a given technology, thus explaining why users may not fully engage with ICT-based agricultural interfaces. Furthermore, sociological and anthropological approaches study the provision of information and trust and how these may be altered by ICT platforms. Drawing upon these disciplines, we suggest that future ICT for agriculture initiatives should first seek to better understand the information and complementary market failures in a given context, in order to better understand whether information is a binding constraint. Second, even if information is missing, the information services provided should be of high quality and from a trusted source, which can be a challenge with some ICT platforms. Finally, such services should be delivered via platforms that build upon local ICT access and usage, paying particular attention to the gender digital divide.},

This study is possibly the first to assess empirically the perception of the risks and benefits of a transgenic food crop - transgenic Bt (Bacillus thuringiemis) eggplant - by farmers in a developing country such as India. It also aims to assess if the moral aspects of risk figure in Indian farmers' perception of Bt eggplant and if economic benefits outweigh perceived risks. To answer the research questions, a scenario was used to elicit perceptions of Bt eggplant among 100 eggplant farmers in the state of Maharashtra in India. The findings indicate that economic benefits, safety concerns, and accountability are most salient to Indian farmers' perception of the risks and benefits of Bt eggplant. Significantly, none of the farmers mentioned moral concerns as an issue. The findings also make clear that economic benefits outweigh perceived risks. This study concludes that economic benefits are more salient than moral concerns to Indian farmers' perception Bt eggplant. It also proposes that an alternative theoretical model incorporating economic benefits, safety concerns, and accountability as key variables should be developed and tested for end users in the developing world.},

abstract = {Conservation agriculture is widely promoted across sub-Saharan Africa as a sustainable farming practice that enhances adaptive capacity to climate change. The interactions between climate stress, management, and soil are critical to understanding the adaptive capacity of conservation agriculture. Yet conservation agriculture syntheses to date have largely neglected climate, especially the effects of extreme heat. For the sub-tropics and tropics, we use meta-regression, in combination with global soil and climate datasets, to test four hypotheses: (1) that relative yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought and temperature stress; (2) that the effects of moisture and temperature stress exposure interact; (3) that the effects of moisture and temperature stress are modified by soil texture; and (4) that crop diversification, fertilizer application rate, or the time since no-till implementation will enhance conservation agriculture performance under climate stress. Our results support the hypothesis that the relative maize yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought severity or exposure to high temperatures. Further, there is an interaction of moisture and heat stress on conservation agriculture performance and their combined effect is both non-additive and modified by soil clay content, supporting our second and third hypotheses. Finally, we found only limited support for our fourth hypothesis as (1) increasing nitrogen application rates did not improve the relative performance of conservation agriculture under high heat stress; (2) crop diversification did not notably improve conservation agriculture performance, but did increase its stability with heat stress; and (3) a statistically robust effect of the time since no-till implementation was not evident. Our meta-regression supports the narrative that conservation agriculture enhances the adaptive capacity of maize production in sub-Saharan Africa under drought and/or heat stress. However, in very wet seasons and on clay-rich soils, conservation agriculture yields less compared to conventional practices.},

abstract = {Understanding farmer behaviour is needed for local agricultural systems to produce food sustainably while facing multiple pressures. We synthesize existing literature to identify three fundamental questions that correspond to three distinct areas of knowledge necessary to understand farmer behaviour: 1) decision-making model; 2) cross-scale and cross-level pressures; and 3) temporal dynamics. We use this framework to compare five interdisciplinary case studies of agricultural systems in distinct geographical contexts across the globe. We find that these three areas of knowledge are important to understanding farmer behaviour, and can be used to guide the interdisciplinary design and interpretation of studies in the future. Most importantly, we find that these three areas need to be addressed simultaneously in order to understand farmer behaviour. We also identify three methodological challenges hindering this understanding: the suitability of theoretical frameworks, the trade-offs among methods and the limited timeframe of typical research projects. We propose that a triangulation research strategy that makes use of mixed methods, or collaborations between researchers across mixed disciplines, can be used to successfully address all three areas simultaneously and show how this strategy has been achieved in the case studies. The framework facilitates interdisciplinary research on farmer behaviour by opening up spaces of structured dialogue on assumptions, research questions and methods employed in investigation.},

abstract = {Purpose: Agricultural advisory services are perceived by many actors involved in rural development as a key driver behind innovation processes in agriculture. However, changes in national and global contexts cause dramatic changes in the orientation of advisory services, their organisation and their methods of intervention. This article aims to analyse the major research topics related to agricultural advice.Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an extensive review of literature produced over a ten-year period that is accessible through the CAB, ECONLIT and Web of Science citation indexes. Using keywords related to extension and advisory services, we selected published articles according to the relevance of the results provided in relation to advisory services and the quality of the discussion on past or current controversies.Findings: The results show that the ongoing scientific debates are shaped by the diversity of disciplines, methods, topics and schools of thought. The scientific community largely has focussed on five main themes: (1) the institutional environment of agricultural advisory services; (2) the structures necessary for the operation of an advisory system; (3) the actors providing advisory services and the skills deployed in advisory activities; (4) the approaches, methods, tools and content of advisory activities; and (5) the assessment and impacts of advisory systems.Practical implications: This literature review is useful for researchers and practitioners to better understand research results in the field of advisory services. It paves the way for future research.Originality/Value: Although many articles have been written in recent decades on agricultural advisory services, few studies provide an overview of the contributions of, and debates in, the international scientific community. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Wageningen University.},

abstract = {While there is a lot of literature from a natural or technical sciences perspective on different forms of digitalization in agriculture (big data, internet of things, augmented reality, robotics, sensors, 3D printing, system integration, ubiquitous connectivity, artificial intelligence, digital twins, and blockchain among others), social science researchers have recently started investigating different aspects of digital agriculture in relation to farm production systems, value chains and food systems. This has led to a burgeoning but scattered social science body of literature. There is hence lack of overview of how this field of study is developing, and what are established, emerging, and new themes and topics. This is where this article aims to make a contribution, beyond introducing this special issue which presents seventeen articles dealing with social, economic and institutional dynamics of precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming or agriculture 4.0. An exploratory literature review shows that five thematic clusters of extant social science literature on digitalization in agriculture can be identified: 1) Adoption, uses and adaptation of digital technologies on farm; 2) Effects of digitalization on farmer identity, farmer skills, and farm work; 3) Power, ownership, privacy and ethics in digitalizing agricultural production systems and value chains; 4) Digitalization and agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS); and 5) Economics and management of digitalized agricultural production systems and value chains. The main contributions of the special issue articles are mapped against these thematic clusters, revealing new insights on the link between digital agriculture and farm diversity, new economic, business and institutional arrangements both on-farm, in the value chain and food system, and in the innovation system, and emerging ways to ethically govern digital agriculture. Emerging lines of social science enquiry within these thematic clusters are identified and new lines are suggested to create a future research agenda on digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0. Also, four potential new thematic social science clusters are also identified, which so far seem weakly developed: 1) Digital agriculture socio-cyber-physical-ecological systems conceptualizations; 2) Digital agriculture policy processes; 3) Digitally enabled agricultural transition pathways; and 4) Global geography of digital agriculture development. This future research agenda provides ample scope for future interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary science on precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0.},

abstract = {Forest and woodland landscape restoration is a key undertaking of renewed interest for forestry and conservation practitioners, but is hampered by the lack of information on the distributions of tree species and of patterns of intra-specific genetic variation. Through the first meta-analysis of its type, we here tested the utility of a high-resolution potential natural vegetation (PNV) map for eastern Africa (vegetationmap4africa) for supporting restoration activities by comparison with 20 molecular marker genetic datasets, identified through literature review and other sources, for ten indigenous tree species. Our analysis indicated that site suitability and stability values from PNV-based ecological niche modelling involving current and past climate scenarios were positively related to population genetic diversity values revealed by molecular markers, supporting the value of PNV maps for the practical planning of restoration activities accounting for anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore, population pairwise genetic divergence was strongly positively correlated with population pairwise geographic distances for most datasets, indicating generalizable sampling implications for tree genetic resource conservation in the region. Population pairwise genetic divergence was however not well explained by sampling across PNV and wider physiognomic types, possibly due to molecular markers' adaptive neutrality and high rates of recombination in trees, among other factors. Patterns of neutral molecular marker variation are thus no substitute for trials of adaptive variation for confirming or refuting the utility of vegetation boundaries in defining tree planting zones. We discuss the importance of results for eastern Africa and more widely.},

The software grew to consist of several hundred thousand lines of code in multiple programming languages. This has led to a large, complex software ecosystem that is difficult to maintain. In addition, systems modellers increasingly require software systems that integrate multiple disciplines, can represent evermore complex farming systems, can run on multiple operating systems (desktop, web, mobile), can operate at or be adjusted to multiple temporal and spatial scales (field, farm, region, continent, global) and run faster for larger simulation analyses.

abstract = {Improved understanding of soil fertility factors limiting crop productivity is important to develop appropriate soil and nutrient management recommendations in sub-Saharan Africa. Diagnostic trials were implemented in Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and Tanzania, as part of the African Soils Information Service (AfSIS) project, to identify soil fertility constraints to crop production across various cropping systems and soil fertility conditions. In each country, one to three sites of 10 km × 10 km were included with each site having 12-31 field trials. The treatments tested included a control, an NPK treatment, three treatments in which the N, P and K nutrients were omitted one at a time from the NPK treatment, and three treatments in which secondary and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Zn and B) simply referred here as multi-nutrients, manure and lime were added to the NPK. The field trials were conducted for 1-2 seasons; the test crop was maize except in Mali where sorghum was used. Nitrogen was limiting in all sites and generally the most limiting nutrient except in Sidindi (Kenya) and Kontela (Mali) where P was the most limiting. The general pattern in Kiberashi (Tanzania) shows none of the nutrients were limiting. K is mainly limiting in only one site (Mbinga) although incidences of K limitation were seen in almost all sites. Addition of multi-nutrients and manure further improved the yields of NPK in most sites. Cluster analyses revealed that maize crop in 11{\%} of fields were highly responsive to nitrogen application, 25{\%} (i.e., 21{\%} poor and 4{\%} fertile) 'non-responsive' to any nutrient or soil amendment, 28{\%} being 'low responsive' and 36{\%} of 'intermediate response'. This study indicates that constraints to crop production vary considerably even within a site, and that addressing limitations in secondary and micronutrients, and increasing soil carbon can improve response to fertilizers. For sustainable crop production intensification in smallholder farming systems in SSA, there is need to develop management strategies to improve efficiency of fertilizer use and of other inputs, recognizing the site-specific nutrient response patterns at various spatial scales.},

abstract = {It is widely recognized that mineral fertilizers must play an important part in improving agricultural productivity in western Kenyan farming systems. This paper suggests that for this goal to be realized, farmers' knowledge must be strengthened to improve their understanding of fertilizers and their use. We analyzed smallholder knowledge of fertilizers and nutrient management, and draw practical lessons from empirical collective fertilizer-response experiments. Data were gathered from the collective fertilizer-response trials, through focus group discussions, by participant observation, and via in-depth interviews representing 40 households. The collective trials showed that the application of nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) alone was insufficient to enhance yields in the study area. The response to P on the trial plots was mainly influenced by incidences of the parasitic Striga weed, by spatial variability or gradients in soil fertility of the experimental plots, and by interactions with N levels. These results inspired farmer to design and conduct experiments to compare crop performance with and without fertilizer, and between types of fertilizers, or responses on different soils. Participating farmers were able to differentiate types of fertilizer, and understood rates of application and the roles of respective fertilizers in nutrient supply. However, notions were broadly generated by unsteady yield responses when fertilizers were used across different fertility gradients, association with high cost (especially if recommended rates were to be applied), association of fertilizer use with hybrids and certain crops, historical factors, among other main aspects. We identified that strengthening fertilizer knowledge must be tailored within existing, albeit imperfect, systems of crop and animal husbandry. Farmers' perceptions cannot be changed by promoting more fertilizer use alone, but may require a more basic approach that, for example, encourages farmer experimentation and practices to enhance soil properties such as carbon build-up in impoverished local soils. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Aim: Traditional African vegetables have high potential to contribute to healthy diets and climate resilience in sub-Saharan African food systems. However, their genetic resources are likely at threat because they are underutilized and under the radar of agricultural research. This paper aims to contribute to a conservation agenda for traditional African vegetables by examining the geographical diversity and conservation status of these species. Location: Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: 126 traditional annual and perennial African vegetables were selected for their food and nutrition potential. Food uses and species' areas of origin were recorded from literature. Species' presence records were collected from open-access databases of genebanks and herbaria. These records were used to determine geographical patterns of observed and modelled richness, to distinguish geographical clusters with different compositions of vegetables, to assess species' ex situ and in situ conservation status and to prioritize countries for conservation actions. Results: Of the 126 species, 79 originated in sub-Saharan Africa. High levels of observed and modelled species richness were found in: (a) West Tropical Africa in Ghana, Togo and Benin; (b) West-Central Tropical Africa in South Cameroon; (c) Northeast and East Tropical Africa in Ethiopia and Tanzania; and (d) Southern Africa in Eswatini. South Sudan, Angola and DR Congo are potential areas of high species richness that require further exploration. In general, ex situ conservation status of the selected species was poor compared to their in situ conservation status. Main conclusions: Areas of high species richness in West Tropical Africa, South Cameroon and Ethiopia coincide with centres of crop domestication and cultural diversity. Hotspots of diversity in Tanzania and Eswatini are especially rich in wild vegetables. Addressing the conservation of vegetable diversity in West Tropical Africa and South Cameroon is of most urgent concern as vegetable genetic resources from these locations are least represented in ex situ collections.},

abstract = {Agricultural extension to improve yields of staple food crops and close the yield gap in Sub-Saharan Africa often entails general recommendations on soil fertility management that are distributed to farmers in a large growing area. Site-specific extension recommendations that are better tailored to the needs of individual farmers and fields, and enabled by digital technologies, could potentially bring about yield and productivity improvements. In this paper, we analyze farmers' preferences for high-input maize production supported by site-specific nutrient management recommendations provided by an ICT-based extension tool that is being developed for extension services in the maize belt of Nigeria. We use a choice experiment to provide ex-ante insights on the adoption potentials of site-specific extension services from the perspective of farmers. We control for attribute non-attendance and account for class as well as scale heterogeneity in preferences using different models, and find robust results. We find that farmers have strong preferences to switch from general to ICT-enabled site-specific soil fertility management recommendations which lend credence to the inclusion of digital technologies in agricultural extension. We find heterogeneity in preferences that is correlated with farmers' resource endowments and access to services. A first group of farmers are strong potential adopters; they are better-off, less sensitive to risk, and are more willing to invest in a high-input maize production system. A second group of farmers are weak potential adopters; they have lower incomes and fewer productive assets, are more sensitive to yield variability, and prefer less capital and labor intensive production techniques. Our empirical findings imply that improving the design of extension tools to enable provision of information on the riskiness of expected outcomes and flexibility in switching between low-risk and high-risk recommendations will help farmers to make better informed decisions, and thereby improve the uptake of extension advice and the efficiency of extension programs.},

abstract = {Agroforestry interventions have the potential to benefit the livelihoods of farmers and communities worldwide. However, given the high system complexity, the long-term benefits of agroforestry are difficult to anticipate. This study aimed to integrate uncertainty into long-term performance projections for agroforestry interventions in the highlands of Northwest Vietnam. We applied decision analysis and probabilistic modeling approaches to produce economic ex-ante assessments for seven agroforestry options (intercropping of maize, forage grass, or coffee with tea, nut, fruit, and timber trees) promoted in the region. Our results indicate that farmers likely prefer annual monocultures due to the relatively early incomes and short time-lag on returns. However, the results also show that annual profits from monocrops can be expected to decrease over time, due mainly to unsustainable soil use. Agroforestry systems, on the other hand, return substantial profits in the long term, but they also incur high establishment and maintenance costs and can generate net losses in the first few years. Initial financial incentives to compensate for these losses may help in promoting agroforestry adoption in the region. Uncertainties related to farmers' time preference, crop yields, and crop prices appeared to have the greatest influence on whether monocropping or agroforestry emerged as the preferable option. Narrowing these key knowledge gaps may offer additional clarity on farmers' optimal course of action and provide guidance for agencies promoting agroforestry interventions in Vietnam and elsewhere. Our model produced a set of plausible ranges for net present values and highlighted critical variables, more clarity on which would support decision-making under uncertainty. Our innovative research approach proved effective in providing forecasts of uncertain outcomes and can be useful for informing similar development interventions in other contexts.},

A survey of 343 smallholder maize farmers was conducted. Most farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya had knowledge about fall armyworm; they could identify it mainly during its larval stage. Furthermore, most farmers in Ethiopia (93{\%}) and Kenya (97{\%}) encountered damage by fall armyworm in their farms. They estimated an average of 32{\%} crop damage in Ethiopia and 47.3{\%} of crop damage in Kenya, with an estimated yield reduction between 0.8 to 1 tonnes/ha. Nearly half of the farmers relied on chemical insecticides to control this pest. The majority (60{\%}) of the farmers in Kenya perceived that insecticides were not effective in controlling fall armyworm as compared to most farmers (46{\%}) in Ethiopia who perceived that chemical spray is effective for the control of fall armyworm. In Ethiopia, 26{\%} of the farmers combined handpicking larvae with insecticide sprays, whilst 15{\%} of the farmers practiced only handpicking. The present study highlights the need to develop management strategies for fall armyworm based on farmers' needs and priorities.},

abstract = {Predicted effects of climate change (CC) on plant species distribution have raised concerns on their conservation and domestication. Appropriate stand density may enhance species ability to adapt to CC. Therefore, combining species distribution modeling (SDM) and spatial pattern of density should provide insightful information for setting conservation actions. We combined geostatistical and SDM techniques to assess (1) current tree density spatial pattern and its relationship with bioclimatic zone (humid, sub-humid, and semi-arid), land-use type (protected areas vs. agrosystems), and soil type (eight types), and (2) present-day and future distributions of suitable habitats under low-RCP4.5 and high-RCP8.5 emissions scenarios for Borassus aethiopum, a declining agroforestry palm in Benin. Data were obtained from 2880 one-ha plots. Semivariogram and kriging were used to model spatial patterns of density while Maximum Entropy was used for SDM. Tree density followed an isotropic spatial model with a range of 2.15 km, indicating extremely fragmented density pattern. Tree density was 8-times higher in protected areas (PAs, 68.6 ± 5.09 trees ha−1) than in agrosystems (8.4 ± 0.31 trees ha−1) and greater on ferruginous soils. Though 80{\%} of the country was currently highly suitable with similar trend for PAs and agrosystems, future predictions showed major habitat loss (20–61{\%}), particularly under RCP8.5. While changes were similar between PAs and agrosystems, the decrease in habitat suitability was pronounced in the semi-arid zone where the species is currently widely-distributed with higher abundance. Very weak link was found between present-day abundance and present-day and future distribution. It is concluded that B. aethiopum has a fragmented density pattern and will be sensitive to CC. In-situ and circa-situ conservations or orchards establishment were suggested depending on the projected changes and the bioclimatic zone. The approach used here is exemplary for other agroforestry tree species.},

abstract = {Soil property and class maps for the continent of Africa were so far only available at very generalised scales, with many countries not mapped at all. Thanks to an increasing quantity and availability of soil samples collected at field point locations by various government and/or NGO funded projects, it is now possible to produce detailed pan-African maps of soil nutrients, including micro-nutrients at fine spatial resolutions. In this paper we describe production of a 30 m resolution Soil Information System of the African continent using, to date, the most comprehensive compilation of soil samples (N≈ 150 , 000) and Earth Observation data. We produced predictions for soil pH, organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), total carbon, effective Cation Exchange Capacity (eCEC), extractable—phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn)—silt, clay and sand, stone content, bulk density and depth to bedrock, at three depths (0, 20 and 50 cm) and using 2-scale 3D Ensemble Machine Learning framework implemented in the mlr (Machine Learning in R) package. As covariate layers we used 250 m resolution (MODIS, PROBA-V and SM2RAIN products), and 30 m resolution (Sentinel-2, Landsat and DTM derivatives) images. Our fivefold spatial Cross-Validation results showed varying accuracy levels ranging from the best performing soil pH (CCC = 0.900) to more poorly predictable extractable phosphorus (CCC = 0.654) and sulphur (CCC = 0.708) and depth to bedrock. Sentinel-2 bands SWIR (B11, B12), NIR (B09, B8A), Landsat SWIR bands, and vertical depth derived from 30 m resolution DTM, were the overall most important 30 m resolution covariates. Climatic data images—SM2RAIN, bioclimatic variables and MODIS Land Surface Temperature—however, remained as the overall most important variables for predicting soil chemical variables at continental scale. This publicly available 30-m Soil Information System of Africa aims at supporting numerous applications, including soil and fertilizer policies and investments, agronomic advice to close yield gaps, environmental programs, or targeting of nutrition interventions.},

abstract = {Yields of crops must increase substantially over the coming decades to keep pace with global food demand driven by population and income growth. Ultimately global food production capacity will be limited by the amount of land and water resources available and suitable for crop production, and by biophysical limits on crop growth. Quantifying food production capacity on every hectare of current farmland in a consistent and transparent manner is needed to inform decisions on policy, research, development and investment that aim to affect future crop yield and land use, and to inform on-ground action by local farmers through their knowledge networks. Crop production capacity can be evaluated by estimating potential yield and water-limited yield levels as benchmarks for crop production under, respectively, irrigated and rainfed conditions. The differences between these theoretical yield levels and actual farmers' yields define the yield gaps, and precise spatially explicit knowledge about these yield gaps is essential to guide sustainable intensification of agriculture. This paper reviews methods to estimate yield gaps, with a focus on the local-to-global relevance of outcomes. Empirical methods estimate yield potential from 90 to 95th percentiles of farmers' yields, maximum yields from experiment stations, growers' yield contests or boundary functions; these are compared with crop simulation of potential or water-limited yields. Comparisons utilize detailed data sets from western Kenya, Nebraska (USA) and Victoria (Australia). We then review global studies, often performed by non-agricultural scientists, aimed at yield and sometimes yield gap assessment and compare several studies in terms of outcomes for regions in Nebraska, Kenya and The Netherlands. Based on our review we recommend key components for a yield gap assessment that can be applied at local to global scales. Given lack of data for some regions, the protocol recommends use of a tiered approach with preferred use of crop growth simulation models applied to relatively homogenous climate zones for which measured weather data are available. Within such zones simulations are performed for the dominant soils and cropping systems considering current spatial distribution of crops. Need for accurate agronomic and current yield data together with calibrated and validated crop models and upscaling methods is emphasized. The bottom-up application of this global protocol allows verification of estimated yield gaps with on-farm data and experiments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An improved understanding of soil fertility variability and farmers' resource use strategies is required for targeting soil fertility improving technologies to different niches within farms. We measured the variability of soil fertility with distance from homesteads on smallholder farms of different socio-economic groups on two soil types, a granite sand and a red clay, in Murewa, northeast Zimbabwe. Soil organic matter, available P and CEC decreased with distance from homestead on most farms. Soil available P was particularly responsive to management, irrespective of soil type, as it was more concentrated on the plots closest to homesteads on wealthy farms (8-13 mg kg-1), compared with plots further from homesteads and all plots on poor farms (2-6 mg kg-1). There was a large gap in amounts of mineral fertilizers used by the wealthiest farmers ({\textgreater}100 kg N and {\textgreater}15 kg P per farm; 39 kg N ha-1 and 7 kg P ha-1) and the poorest farmers ({\textless}20 kg N and {\textless}10 kg P per farm; 19 kg N ha-1 and 4 kg P ha-1). The wealthy farmers who owned cattle also used large amounts of manure, which provided at least 90 kg N and 25 kg P per farm per year (36 kg N ha-1 and 10 kg P ha-1). The poor farmers used little or no organic sources of nutrients. The wealthiest farmers distributed mineral fertilizers evenly across their farms, but preferentially targeted manure to the plots closest to the homesteads, which received about 70 kg N and 18 kg P per plot (76 kg N ha-1 and 21 kg P ha-1) from manure compared with 23 kg N and 9 kg P per plot on the mid-fields (26 kg N ha-1 and 10 kg P ha-1), and 10 kg N and 1 kg P per plot (and ha-1) on the outfields. Crop allocation on the homefields was most diversified on the wealthiest farms where maize was allocated 41{\%} of the area followed by grain legumes (24{\%}) and paprika (21{\%}). Maize was allocated at least 83{\%} of the homefields on farms with less access to resources. All the farmers invariably applied nutrients to maize but little to groundnut. Maize grain yields were largest on the homefields on the wealthy farms (2.7-5.0 t ha-1), but poor across all fields on the poor farms (0.3-1.9 t ha-1). Groundnut grain yields showed little difference between farms and plots. N and P partial balances were largest on the wealthy farms, although these fluctuated from season to season (-20 to +80 kg N per farm and 15-30 kg P per farm; average 21 kg N ha-1 and 8 kg P ha-1). The partial balances on the wealthy farms were largest on the homefield (20-30 kg N and 13 kg P per plot; {\textgreater}26 kg N ha-1 and {\textgreater}13 kg P ha-1), but decreased to 10-20 N and 6-9 kg P per plot ({\textless}20 kg N ha-1 and 13 kg P ha-1) in mid-fields and -7 to +10 kg N and -1 to +1 kg P per plot ({\textless}10 kg N ha-1 and {\textless}2 kg P ha-1) in the outfields. N and P balances differed little across plots on the poor farms (-2 to +4 kg per plot; -5 to +4 kg ha-1) due to limited nutrients applied and small off-take from small harvests. This study highlights the need to consider soil fertility gradients and the crop and nutrient management patterns creating them when designing options to improve resource use efficiency on smallholder farms. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Soil pH is an indispensable part of the soil bionetwork, but so vulnerable to the dynamics of land-use change. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of soil pH is thus important for sustainable land use planning and management. In this study, we developed an approach based on geographically weighted regression-kriging (GWRK) to predict the continuous variation of soil pH up to 15 cm depth. The approach is compared to multiple linear regression-kriging (MLRK) using a total of 220 soil observations and 28 candidate auxiliary data, including climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed data. Results revealed that organic matter, sand, silt, temperature, and Landsat 8 operational land imager band 7 can explain the spatial variability of soil pH. GWR-based (local) models remarkably improved the prediction accuracy of soil pH compared to the MLR-based (global) models considering the root mean square error (i.e., 0.33 vs. 0.15; 0.37 vs. 0.17, respectively) and the coefficient of multiple determination (R2) (i.e., 0.59 vs. 0.74; 0.43 vs. 0.55, respectively). In conclusion, the use of GWR-based models revealed that the correlations between soil pH and environmental covariates were not stationary in space. Forested areas tended to be very strongly to moderately acidic, while croplands were slightly acidic to neutral. The GWR-based models demonstrated their utility in improving predictive soil mapping. These findings will support spatially-targeted soil pH management for improved food security and ecosystem health.},

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper examines factors influencing behavioural change among smallholder farmers towards adaptation to climate change in transitional climatic zones of Africa, specifically, Hwedza District in Zimbabwe. Data for this study were collected from 400 randomly-selected smallholder farmers, using a structured questionnaire, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The study used an ordered logit model to examine the factors that influence smallholder farmers' behavioural intention towards adaptation to climate change. Results from the study show that the gender of the household head, access to extension services on crop and livestock production, access to climate information, membership to social groups and experiencing a drought have a positive influence on farmers' attitude towards adaptation to climate change and variability. The study concluded that although the majority of smallholder farmers perceive that the climate is changing, they continue to habour negative attitudes towards prescribed climate change adaptation techniques. This study recommends more education on climate change, as well as adaptation strategies for both agricultural extension workers and farmers. This can be complemented by disseminating timely climate information through extension officers and farmers' groups.},

abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, there is considerable spatial and temporal variability in relations between nutrient application and crop yield, due to varying inherent soil nutrients supply, soil moisture, crop management and germplasm. This variability affects fertilizer use efficiency and crop productivity. Therefore, development of decision systems that support formulation and delivery of site-specific fertilizer recommendations is important for increased crop yield and environmental protection. Nutrient Expert (NE) is a computer-based decision support system, which enables extension advisers to generate field- or area-specific fertilizer recommendations based on yield response to fertilizer and nutrient use efficiency. We calibrated NE for major maize agroecological zones in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, with data generated from 735 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted between 2015 and 2017. Between 2016 and 2018, 368 NE performance trials were conducted across the three countries in which recommendations generated with NE were evaluated relative to soil-test based recommendations, the current blanket fertilizer recommendations and a control with no fertilizer applied. Although maize yield response to fertilizer differed with geographic location; on average, maize yield response to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were respectively 2.4, 1.6 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Nigeria, 2.3, 0.9 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Ethiopia, and 1.5, 0.8 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Tanzania. Secondary and micronutrients increased maize yield only in specific areas in each country. Agronomic use efficiencies of N were 18, 22 and 13 kg grain kg−1 N, on average, in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, respectively. In Nigeria, NE recommended lower amounts of P by 9 and 11 kg ha−1 and K by 24 and 38 kg ha−1 than soil-test based and regional fertilizer recommendations, respectively. Yet maize yield (4 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Agronomic use efficiencies of P and K (300 and 250 kg kg−1, respectively) were higher with NE than with the blanket recommendation (150 and 70 kg kg−1). In Ethiopia, NE and soil-test based respectively recommended lower amounts of P by 8 and 19 kg ha−1 than the blanket recommendations, but maize yield (6 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Overall, fertilizer recommendations generated with NE maintained high maize yield, but at a lower fertilizer input cost than conventional methods. NE was effective as a simple and cost-effective decision support tool for fine-tuning fertilizer recommendations to farm-specific conditions and offers an alternative to soil testing, which is hardly available to most smallholder farmers.},

abstract = {Context: Land use and land cover (LULC) changes may affect the provision of ecosystem services. However, little is known how LULC changes influence the spatio-temporal variation in ecosystem service and their interactions along altitudinal gradients. Objectives: Here we assessed the spatio-temporal variation of eight ecosystem services in an altitudinal gradient between the year of 1986 and 2015, and quantified the effect of LULC transitions on the provision and interactions of ecosystems services. Methods: We modelled and mapped eight ecosystem services in an altitudinal gradient characterized by low ({\textless} 600 m), middle (600–1200) and high altitudes ({\textgreater} 1200) in Zona da Mata, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. We quantified changes in ecosystem services by contrasting ecosystem service maps between 1986 and 2015, and explored how four common LULC transitions affected the variation and the interactions between the eight ecosystem services. Results: The spatio-temporal analysis indicated that six out of eight ecosystem services increased from 1986 to 2015, while soil erosion control and water flow regulation decreased. In areas above 1200 m, regulating services dominated, while in areas below 1200 m provisioning service were most evidenced. LULC transitions from forest to agricultural areas, and vice versa, resulted in trade-offs between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Conclusions: LULC changes drive the spatio-temporal variation of ecosystem services along an altitudinal gradient with contrasting biophysical conditions. Future management of ecosystem services in the landscapes should take into the account the biophysical conditions and the consequences of specific LULC transitions.},

In many developing countries, such as Kenya, information on the mean changes in climate is limited. Therefore, in this study, we model the current and future changes in areas suitable for rainfed maize production in the country using a maximum entropy (MaxENT) model. Maize is by far a major staple food crop in Kenya. We used maize occurrence location data and bioclimatic variables for two climatic scenarios-Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 from two general circulation models (HadGEM2-ES and CCSM4) for 2070. The study identified the annual mean temperature, annual precipitation and the mean temperature of the wettest quarter as the major variables that affect the distribution of maize. Simulation results indicate an average increase of unsuitable areas of between 1.9–3.9{\%} and a decrease of moderately suitable areas of 14.6–17.5{\%}. The change in the suitable areas is an increase of between 17–20{\%} and in highly suitable areas of 9.6{\%} under the climatic scenarios. The findings of this study are of utmost importance to the country as they present an opportunity for policy makers to develop appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies required to sustain maize production under future climates.},

abstract = {Agricultural modeling has long suffered from fragmentation in model implementation. Many models are developed, there is much redundancy, models are often poorly coupled, model component re-use is rare, and it is frequently difficult to apply models to generate real solutions for the agricultural sector. To improve this situation, we argue that an open, self-sustained, and committed community is required to co-develop agricultural models and associated data and tools as a common resource. Such a community can benefit from recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT). We examine how such developments can be leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, and decision support tools for agricultural production systems. Our objective is to assess relevant technologies for their maturity, expected development, and potential to benefit the agricultural modeling community. The technologies considered encompass methods for collaborative development and for involving stakeholders and users in development in a transdisciplinary manner. Our qualitative evaluation suggests that as an overall research challenge, the interoperability of data sources, modular granular open models, reference data sets for applications and specific user requirements analysis methodologies need to be addressed to allow agricultural modeling to enter in the big data era. This will enable much higher analytical capacities and the integrated use of new data sources. Overall agricultural systems modeling needs to rapidly adopt and absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies with a focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating those who develop applications of their models. This adoption requires the widespread uptake of a set of best practices as standard operating procedures.},

abstract = {Approaches that aim to identify and prioritize locally appropriate climate smart agriculture (CSA) technologies will need to address the context-specific multi-dimensional complexity in agricultural systems. The climate smart agriculture rapid appraisal (CSA-RA) is a mixed method approach that draws on participatory bottom-up, qualitative, and quantitative tools to assess the heterogeneity of local contexts, and prioritize context-specific CSA options. This is an imperative if countries are to respond to the COP21 agreement and meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The CSA-RA is designed to assess biophysical including climatic, socio-cultural, economic and technological characteristics at the household, farm and community/regional level. The CSA-RA employs gender-disaggregated methods, including gender differences in perceptions of climate change and its impacts. The CSA-RA combines common participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools into one methodology, that disaggregates the gender dimension, and includes resource mapping; climate calendars; historical calendars; cropping calendars; organization mapping; transect walks; key informant interviews; farmer interviews; and pairwise ranking matrix. The tool collects qualitative and quantitative data from various stakeholders (farmers, local leaders, researchers, local-level agricultural experts, private sector actors, donor organizations, and policy implementers), allowing expansive analysis, triangulation and validation. Application of the CSA-RA in Tanzania and Uganda reveals heterogeneity across the sites in terms of vulnerability, constraints and CSA priorities among different social groups (gender) and agro-ecological zones. Thus, the CSA-RA allows stakeholders to simultaneously take into account biophysical and socio-economic aspects to target and implement CSA.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure, densities and utilization of tree populations in agricultural landscapes is useful in determining the species influencing agroecosystem function. Our study evaluated agroforestry adoption and practices within smallholder farms in a former large-scale maize growing area of Trans Nzoia County, Rift Valley Province, Kenya. This was followed by investigation of factors influencing heterogeneity in the adoption and practices. The factors include: household resource endowment, land tenure and time under current management. Five settlement schemes which were formerly large estates dominated by maize mono-cropping were selected for the current study. Tree inventories of the farms were obtained through transect walks across each settlement. A total of 123 farms were assessed representing households of different resource endowment levels, tenure and number of years under current management. Different analyses were carried out including farm size and tree number, tree density, tree diversity and utilization of the dominant tree species. In total, we identified 44 tree/shrub species, 24 of which were indigenous and the rest exotic. However, the exotic tree species dominated strongly in abundance with Eucalyptus spp. being the most frequent taxon and constituting 34.6{\%} of all trees. Species richness was found to be low compared to other agricultural landscapes in the region. Resource constrained households were found to prefer fruit tree species and maintained high tree diversity on their farms. Households with secure tenure had higher tree diversity than those without who had higherspecies richness and opted for fast growing fodder and fertilizer/firewood trees. Younger farms had fewer trees but higher species richness than older farms. The study, therefore, explains heterogeneity in agroforestry adoption in terms of variation in household resource endowment, land tenure and time under current management levels.},

abstract = {The core of many changes towards a more sustainable agriculture is the individual decision-maker. The decisions of each farmer have impacts on sustainability and are made in a complex world of contradictious interests and values. Agricultural decision support systems (AgriDSS) will be a major contributor in the realization of a viable farm economy with less nega-tive environmental impact, but it must not only provide current and relevant information. Current DSSs available to farmers, advisors, experts, and policy makers are not used to their full poten-tial. One reason is that they fail to capture the actual needs of the farmers and to understand their decision-making in practice. They are not adapted to the high complexity characterizing sustaina-ble land use decision-making. Among farmers the acceptance of these systems are low, partly because existing DSS are based on what scientists and system developers consider as necessary. As a result, new linkages and better understanding between different stakeholders in agriculture has to be improved. The user-centred design (UCD) approach can answer the core of the identi-fied problems of most DSSs, because it put the farmers' experience in focus and involve them early and continuously in the design process. In this paper we discuss next generation's AgriDSS which are useful and useable for farmers and other stakeholders. By introducing theories from UCD, illustrated by the Swedish case of imple-menting Precision Agriculture, we show what is needed to make new technologies contribute to resilient farms and farming systems. We argue that there is a dual link between environmental sustainability and information systems (IS) addressing both sustainability through design – how IS can be used to promote more sustainable behaviours, and sustainability in design – how sus-tainability can be the governing principle of the design of the information systems themselves. Consequently, the next generation's AgriDSS must simultaneously enable stakeholders to get access to the best knowledge available, and at the same time involve them in the process of de-veloping the user interface design. To use existing and future information efficiently, participa-tory approaches are therefore crucial and need to be a part of transition towards sustainable agri-culture.},

abstract = {This paper documents a positive relationship between maize productivity in western Kenya and women's empowerment in agriculture, measured using indicators derived from the abbreviated version of the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. Applying a cross-sectional instrumental-variable regression method to a data set of 707 maize farm households from western Kenya, we find that women's empowerment in agriculture significantly increases maize productivity. Although all indicators of women's empowerment significantly increase productivity, there is no significant association between the women's workload (amount of time spent working) and maize productivity. Furthermore, the results show heter-ogenous effects with respect to women's empowerment on maize productivity for farm plots managed jointly by a male and female and plots managed individually by only a male or female. More specifically, the results suggest that female- and male-managed plots experience significant improvements in productivity when the women who tend them are empowered. These findings provide evidence that women's empowerment contributes not only to reducing the gender gap in agricultural productivity, but also to improving, specifically, productivity from farms managed by women. Thus, rural development interventions in Kenya that aim to increase agricultural productivity—and, by extension, improve food security and reduce poverty—could achieve greater impact by integrating women's empowerment into existing and future projects.},

abstract = {The article provides a conceptual framework and discusses research methods for analyzing pluralistic agricultural advisory services. The framework can also assist policy-makers in identifying reform options. It addresses the following question: Which forms of providing and financing agricultural advisory services work best in which situation? The framework ‘disentangles' agricultural advisory services by distinguishing between (1) governance structures, (2) capacity, (3) management, and (4) advisory methods. The framework suggests an impact chain approach to analyze the performance and impact of agricultural advisory services and discusses theoretical and empirical research methods that can be used when applying the framework. The framework shows that reforms of agricultural advisory services can combine different reform elements*such as decentralization, contracting out, using new advisory methods, and changing the management style*in different ways so as to best fit local circumstances. Using a New Institutional Economics approach (transaction costs approach), the article shows that the following sets of contextual factors need to be considered in this regard: the policy environment; the capacity of potential service providers; the type of production systems and market access of farm households; and the characteristics of local communities. The framework can be used to develop assessment tools for agricultural advisory services, to inform processes of reforming of agricultural advisory services and to guide inter-disciplinary research. The framework is unique in combining the insights from different disciplines, which have, so far, been treated separately in the literature. The framework can help policy-makers and analysts to move from ‘ideological' discussions on reform models to an evidence-based ‘best fit' approach.},

In tropical areas, wild palms are highly valued keystone resources with growing demand for both subsistence uses and commercial trade. Here we focused on eight such species (Borassus aethiopum Mart., Eremospathamacrocarpa (G.Mann {\&} H.Wendl.) H.Wendl., Hyphaene thebaica Mart., Laccosperma opacum (G.Mann {\&} H.Wendl.)

This study tested (i) how those palms distributions may be affected under future climate scenarios, and (ii) if species are effectively conserved currently and under future forecasts for their native distributional areas. Finally, we defined spatial priorities for the species' conservation. Available bioclimatic and soil data layers were used for the modelling with maximum entropy approaches, and resulting maps were overlaid on the existing protected areas network. Results showed that much of the distribution of the species will remain largely stable, albeit with some expansion and retraction in some species; relationships with protected areas networks suggest that protected portions of species distributions will also remain stable. The areas identified as highest conservation priority differ between models even though the highest-priority areas holding most palm species are located along the coast (from Guinea to Nigeria). Further development of these analyses could aid in forming a more complete picture of the distributions and populations of the species, which in turn could aid in developing effective conservation strategies for this botanically important family.},

abstract = {Although many agronomic researchers currently focus on designing and developing decision support systems, they rarely discuss the methodological implications of such work. In this paper, with the examples of two decision support systems, we propose methodological elements for conducting the participatory design of such tools. Our proposition aims at building dialogue between designers and users but also between humans, tools and work situations. We focus on two main stages: first, a diagnosis of the uses of decision tools within current working situations and, second, the use of a prototype of the tool under design. The first stage serves to characterize the diversity of uses and user situations in order to determine the tool's flexibility and to identify new concepts for tools. The second stage involves setting up an arrangement whereby a prototype of the decision support tool, open to amendment, can be used in work-like situations and then discussed during debriefing sessions among designers and users. This stage mediates dialogue between all the participants and allows them to develop cross-learning processes. We discuss how these two stages allow for a coordinated expansion of three spaces: the concept space, the knowledge space and the use space. We then discuss the need for such participatory design processes described as dialogical design processes and their contribution to produce new agronomic knowledge supporting a more sustainable agriculture. Finally, we point out a need to provide more opportunity for scientific discussion on participatory design approaches and on design methodology more broadly within the agronomic community. {\textcopyright} INRA and Springer-Verlag, France 2012.},

abstract = {Accurate data of the natural conditions and agricultural systems with a good spatial resolution are a key factor to tackle food insecurity in developing countries. A broad variety of approaches exists to achieve precise data and information about agriculture. One system, especially developed for smallholder agriculture in East Africa, is the Farm Management Handbook of Kenya. It was first published in 1982/83 and fully revised in 2012, now containing 7 volumes. The handbooks contain detailed information on climate, soils, suitable crops and soil care based on scientific research results of the last 30 years. The density of facts leads to time consuming extraction of all necessary information. In this study we analyse the user needs and necessary components of a system for decision support for smallholder farming in Kenya based on a geographical information system (GIS). Required data sources were identified, as well as essential functions of the system. We analysed the results of our survey conducted in 2012 and early 2013 among agricultural officers. The monitoring of user needs and the problem of non-adaptability of an agricultural information system on the level of extension officers in Kenya are the central objectives. The outcomes of the survey suggest the establishment of a decision support tool based on already available open source GIS components. The system should include functionalities to show general information for a specific location and should provide precise recommendations about suitable crops and management options to support agricultural guidance on farm level.},

abstract = {Agroforestry has large potential for carbon (C) sequestration while providing many economical, social, and ecological benefits via its diversified products. Airborne lidar is considered as the most accurate technology for mapping aboveground biomass (AGB) over landscape levels. However, little research in the past has been done to study AGB of agroforestry systems using airborne lidar data. Focusing on an agroforestry system in the Brazilian Amazon, this study first predicted plot-level AGB using fixed-effects regression models that assumed the regression coefficients to be constants. The model prediction errors were then analyzed from the perspectives of tree DBH (diameter at breast height)-height relationships and plot-level wood density, which suggested the need for stratifying agroforestry fields to improve plot-level AGB modeling. We separated teak plantations from other agroforestry types and predicted AGB using mixed-effects models that can incorporate the variation of AGB-height relationship across agroforestry types. We found that, at the plot scale, mixed-effects models led to better model prediction performance (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) than the fixed-effects models, with the coefficient of determination (R2) increasing from 0.38 to 0.64. At the landscape level, the difference between AGB densities from the two types of models was {\~{}}10{\%} on average and up to {\~{}}30{\%} at the pixel level. This study suggested the importance of stratification based on tree AGB allometry and the utility of mixed-effects models in modeling and mapping AGB of agroforestry systems.},

abstract = {Low fertilizer application rates for several decades have depleted soil nutrients in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and contributed to relatively stagnant maize (Zea mays L.) yields. As maize is a staple crop, nutrient depletion has resulted in major food insecurity. While one potential solution is to apply more nitrogen (N) fertilizer, previous studies in SSA have found maize yield responses to be variable, likely because N is often not the only limiting nutrient. This study aimed to determine the impact of consecutive N fertilizer applications on plant uptake and available soil reserves of non-N nutrients. Maize was grown continuously in 3 sites that were representative of the ecosystem variability found in East/Southern Africa (Embu, Kenya; Kiboko, Kenya; Harare, Zimbabwe) at 4 different N fertilizer rates (0–160 kg N ha−1) from 2010 to 2015. Following the final season, grain, stover, and soil (sampled at different depths to 0.9 m) samples were analyzed for essential plant nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer increased plant uptake of P, S, Cu, and Zn by up to 280{\%}, 320{\%}, 420{\%}, and 210{\%}, respectively, showing potential for mitigating non-N nutrient deficiencies in 2 of the 3 sites. Cumulatively, however, there was a net negative effect of higher N rates on the P, K, and S soil-plant balances in all sites and on the Mn and Cu soil-plant balance in Kiboko, indicating that applying N fertilizer depletes non-N soil nutrients. While N fertilizer enhances the uptake of non-N nutrients, a balanced application of multiple essential nutrients is needed to sustainably increase yields in SSA.},

abstract = {Drawing on Boserupian and induced innovation principles, this review explores how the farm technologies and practices associated with integrated soil management and sustainable intensification may vary spatially according to the heterogenous ways in which economic transformation and population dynamics are influencing agricultural factor prices. Long-term trends in many areas are encouraging intensification of capital inputs, including fertilizer use. However, low agronomic efficiency of nitrogen poses a major constraint on fertilizer profitability and use. Integrated soil and agronomic management practices can improve the agronomic efficiency of fertilizer use, but achieving greater adoption of such practices will require greater understanding of best practices for the wide range of environmental conditions and farmer resource constraints in the region. Because sustainable resource managment best practices are highly localized and knowledge-intensive, massively increased investment in localized adaptive farm-level research and extension systems will be required to catalyze sustainable intensification in Africa.},

abstract = {Soil property and class maps for the continent of Africa were so far only available at very generalised scales, with many countries not mapped at all. Thanks to an increasing quantity and availability of soil samples collected at field point locations by various government and/or NGO funded projects, it is now possible to produce detailed pan-African maps of soil nutrients, including micro-nutrients at fine spatial resolutions. In this paper we describe production of a 30 m resolution Soil Information System of the African continent using, to date, the most comprehensive compilation of soil samples (N≈ 150 , 000) and Earth Observation data. We produced predictions for soil pH, organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), total carbon, effective Cation Exchange Capacity (eCEC), extractable—phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn)—silt, clay and sand, stone content, bulk density and depth to bedrock, at three depths (0, 20 and 50 cm) and using 2-scale 3D Ensemble Machine Learning framework implemented in the mlr (Machine Learning in R) package. As covariate layers we used 250 m resolution (MODIS, PROBA-V and SM2RAIN products), and 30 m resolution (Sentinel-2, Landsat and DTM derivatives) images. Our fivefold spatial Cross-Validation results showed varying accuracy levels ranging from the best performing soil pH (CCC = 0.900) to more poorly predictable extractable phosphorus (CCC = 0.654) and sulphur (CCC = 0.708) and depth to bedrock. Sentinel-2 bands SWIR (B11, B12), NIR (B09, B8A), Landsat SWIR bands, and vertical depth derived from 30 m resolution DTM, were the overall most important 30 m resolution covariates. Climatic data images—SM2RAIN, bioclimatic variables and MODIS Land Surface Temperature—however, remained as the overall most important variables for predicting soil chemical variables at continental scale. This publicly available 30-m Soil Information System of Africa aims at supporting numerous applications, including soil and fertilizer policies and investments, agronomic advice to close yield gaps, environmental programs, or targeting of nutrition interventions.},

abstract = {A strong agricultural sector provides a sound foundation for a prosperous country. From this recognition, the goal of the government is expressed in Kenya Vision 2030; that is ‘a viable and vibrant agricultural sector that is commercially oriented' and can compete at international level with more advanced world economies. Agriculture is the backbone of our country and provides livelihood, employment and generates income for the population. The sector is among the key drivers envisaged to deliver the 10{\%} annual economic growth stipulated in the Economic Pillar of Vision 2030. The sector, however, faces a number of challenges which include reduced productivity, high cost of farm inputs, inefficient utilization of inputs, poor adoption of mechanization, impacts of climate change and lack of access to agricultural credit. In tandem with the Vision of the Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS); “A food secure and prosperous Nation”,the Ministry established a program called the National Accelerated Agricultural Inputs Access Programme (NAAIAP) to empower resource poor smallholder farmers engaged in maize production through provision of farm inputs grants to support their normal livelihood activities. The program promotes sustainable public private sector partnerships through subsidized credit aimed at ensuring that smallholder farmers and businesses along the maize value chain access farm inputs. The country's fertilizer market is fully liberalized with the bulk of fertilizers imported and distributed by the private sector. However, since 2008, the government through the fertilizer subsidy program has procured 494,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer in support of the agricultural sector. A vibrant network of over 5,000 agrodealers situated in major towns and market centres in the country has developed, providing employment opportunities and contributing towards food security for the nation. The staple food crops in Kenya include maize, beans, rice, potatoes and sorghum. The production of these crops is estimated as follows; beans (7.3 million bags), rice (2.5 million (50kg) bags), potatoes (5.6 metric tonnes), wheat (1.8 million bags), sorghum (1.9 million bags), and millet (1 million bags). In the case of maize, the estimated annual production is 40 million bags against a national requirement of 42 million bags (Economic Survey 2013, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics).

It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, with the adult moth able to move over 100 km per night. It lays its eggs on plants, from which larvae hatch and begin feeding. High infestations can lead to significant yield loss. Farmers in the Americas have been managing the pest for many years, but at significant cost. Nature of the threat and its spread in Africa FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 (Sao Tome and Principe, Nigeria, Benin and Togo) and in late 2016 and 2017 in Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and it is expected to move further. Although it is too early to know the long-term impact of FAW on agricultural production and food security in Africa, it has the potential to cause serious damage and yield losses. FAW's presence in Africa is irreversible. Large-scale eradication eeorts are neither appropriate nor feasible.

The different products are ranked at the national level using crowdsourced data from Geo-Wiki to create a map that reflects the likelihood of cropland. Calibration with national and subnational crop statistics was then undertaken to distribute the cropland within each country and subnational unit. The new IIASA-IFPRI cropland product has been validated using very high-resolution satellite imagery via Geo-Wiki and has an overall accuracy of 82.4{\%}. It has also been compared with the EarthStat cropland product and shows a lower root mean square error on an independent data set collected from Geo-Wiki. The first ever global field size map was produced at the same resolution as the IIASA-IFPRI cropland map based on interpolation of field size data collected via a Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing campaign. A validation exercise of the global field size map revealed satisfactory agreement with control data, particularly given the relatively modest size of the field size data set used to create the map. Both are critical inputs to global agricultural monitoring in the frame of GEOGLAM and will serve the global land modelling and integrated assessment community, in particular for improving land use models that require baseline cropland information.

abstract = {The large uncertainty in yield response to fertilizer application within smallholder cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) limits efforts aimed at intensifying crop production based on increased fertilizer application. We assessed the key field-scale cause of variability in maize (Zea mays) grain yield response to fertilizer nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the Sidindi area of Western Kenya based on past manure application, distance from the homestead, and clay and silt contents. We used data from nutrient omission trials conducted on 23 farms over seven consecutive cropping seasons covering the period 2013–2016, without changing treatments or plot location. Treatments included a control and PK, NK, NP and NPK. Accounting for past manure application increased the explained variability in maize yield, and yield response to N, P, and K application. Mean treatment maize grain yield in the control, PK, NK, NP and NPK treatments were 1.0, 2.2, 1.5, 2.9 and 4.5 t ha −1 at 88{\%} dry matter respectively in fields without past manure application, and 2.4, 2.7, 4.4, 4.9 and 5.4 t ha -1 in fields which had received animal manure in at least two out of three seasons prior to the start of the trials. Mean maize yield response to N, P and K application was 2.3, 3.0 and 1.6 t ha −1 respectively in fields without past manure application, and 2.8, 1.1 and 0.6 t ha −1 in fields with past manure application. In the seventh cropping season, past animal manure application contributed a fertilizer equivalent of 28.3, 29.8 and 31.5 kg ha −1 of N, P and K, respectively. At both the onset and at the start of the last season, fields with past animal manure application had on average higher contents of SOC, available P and exchangeable K, yet differences were not always significant within treatments. Accounting for past animal manure application reduces crop fertilizer requirements for P and K as well as decreasing uncertainty in yield response to fertilizer. We conclude that the strong influence of past animal manure application on yield response to fertilizer application merits the inclusion of past manure application as a co-variate in analysis of yield response data from smallholder cropping systems of SSA.},

This study explores the challenges that small-scale farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face when using a mobile phone technology in crop farming projects and proposes areas for future improvement. The study used a systematic literature search conducted by authors at 3 levels, in which 134 studies initially identified were then narrowed to 11. These 11 studies generated 7 projects that use specialized applications in a farming value chain. The findings from the study indicate some of the challenges faced by small-scale farmers, including the lack of their involvement in the initial phase of the invention process. Other obstacles include low trust and transparency, inappropriate use of foreign language (English) in a local cultural context, bureaucracy, and theft of mobile phones. On the basis of these results, the authors conclude that there are generalized factors for understanding deficiencies experienced by small-scale farmers, which ought to be understood by all crop farming stakeholders. These factors can be used by software engineers to design future technologies beneficial to small-scale farmers.},

abstract = {Agricultural landscapes are increasingly being managed with the aim of enhancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services and sustainability of production systems. However, agricultural management that maximizes provisioning ecosystem services can often reduce both regulating and maintenance services. We hypothesized that agroforestry reduces trade-offs between provisioning and regulating/maintenance services. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of studies carried out in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on crop yield (as an indicator of provisioning services), soil fertility, erosion control, and water regulation (as indicators of regulating/maintenance services). A total of 1106 observations were extracted from 126 peer-reviewed publications that fulfilled the selection criteria for meta-analysis of studies comparing agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices (hereafter control) in sub-Saharan Africa. Across ecological conditions, agroforestry significantly increased crop yield, total soil nitrogen, soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus compared to the control. Agroforestry practices also reduced runoff and soil loss and improved infiltration rates and soil moisture content. No significant differences were detected between the different ecological conditions, management regimes, and types of woody perennials for any of the ecosystem services. Main trade-offs included low available phosphorus and low soil moisture against higher crop yield. This is the first meta-analysis that shows that, on average, agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa increase crop yield while maintaining delivery of regulating/maintenance ecosystem services. We also demonstrate how woody perennials have been managed in agricultural landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services without sacrificing crop productivity. This is important in rural livelihoods where the range of ecosystem services conveys benefits in terms of food security and resilience to environmental shocks.},

abstract = {Agriculture can serve as an important engine for economic growth in developing countries, yet yields in these countries have lagged far behind those in developed countries for decades. One potential mechanism for increasing yields is the use of improved agricultural technologies, such as fertilizers, seeds, and cropping techniques. Public sector programs have attempted to overcome information-related barriers to technological adoption by providing agricultural extension services. While such programs have been widely criticized for their limited scale, sustainability, and impact, the rapid spread of mobile phone coverage in developing countries provides a unique opportunity to facilitate technological adoption via information and communication technology (ICT)-based extension programs. This article outlines the potential mechanisms through which ICT could facilitate agricultural adoption and the provision of extension services in developing countries. It then reviews existing programs using ICT for agriculture, categorized by the mechanism (voice, text, internet, and mobile money transfers) and the type of services provided. Finally, we identify potential constraints to such programs in terms of design and implementation, and conclude with some recommendations for implementing field-based research on the impact of these programs on farmers' knowledge, technological adoption, and welfare. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

abstract = {Agricultural innovation systems (AIS) are increasingly recognized as complex adaptive systems in which interventions cannot be expected to create predictable, linear impacts. Nevertheless, the logic models and theory of change (ToC) used by standard-setting international agricultural research agencies and donors assume that agricultural research will create impact through a predictable linear adoption pathway which largely ignores the complexity dynamics of AIS, and which misses important alternate pathways through which agricultural research can improve system performance and generate sustainable development impact. Despite a growing body of literature calling for more dynamic, flexible and “complexity-aware” approaches to monitoring and evaluation, few concrete examples exist of ToC that takes complexity dynamics within AIS into account, or provide guidance on how such theories could be developed. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an example of how an empirically-grounded, complexity-aware ToC can be developed and what such a model might look like in the context of a particular type of program intervention. Two detailed case studies are presented from an agricultural research program which was explicitly seeking to work in a “complexity-aware” way within aquatic agricultural systems in Zambia and the Philippines. Through an analysis of the outcomes of these interventions, the pathways through which they began to produce impacts, and the causal factors at play, we derive a “complexity-aware” ToC to model how the cases worked. This middle-range model, as well as an overarching model that we derive from it, offer an alternate narrative of how development change can be produced in agricultural systems, one which aligns with insights from complexity science and which, we argue, more closely represents the ways in which many research for development interventions work in practice. The nested ToC offers a starting point for asking a different set of evaluation and research questions which may be more relevant to participatory research efforts working from within a complexity-aware, agricultural innovation systems perspective.},

abstract = {Climate change is already negatively affecting Sub Saharan African agriculture. One of the most effective ways to adapt on farm is to switch crop varieties. This technological change depends on the policies and institutions involved in governing the seed systems on which farmers rely for access to suitable seeds. Whilst the need for seed systems to adapt and become more resilient is indisputable, the question of how this is best achieved is debated. The dominant seed system development pathway promoted by international development actors is characterized by formalization and commercialization of the seed sector. In order to assess political and social outcomes of this development agenda, we compare maize seed system development in Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania, combining policy analysis with quantitative analysis of farmers' seed use. We show that while the development policies promoted by international donors have similar objectives in the three countries, national policies and the seed systems farmers use differ substantially. National policies are shaped by political and historical factors and established in an interplay between state institutions, international donors and private input suppliers. Drawing on a new livelihood dataset, we show that in all three countries the formalization agenda is most visible in maize seed systems, with 25, 61, and 58{\%} of the maize farmers planting improved maize varieties in the study sites in Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania, respectively. The inroads of improved maize, and particularly hybrid maize, in farmers' seed systems reflects these seeds high profitability for private seed companies. The tenuous use of improved varieties in crops such as sorghum reflects the limitation of the private sector-based seed system development approach in other crops and illustrates the need for public research and governance. Comparison of households cultivating improved maize with households cultivating local maize reveals that the first group is significantly wealthier and more food secure than the latter. This suggests that better-off households are likely to benefit first from the commercial formalization agenda. We argue that climate-smart seed policies and seed system development strategies must be sensitive to differences between farming systems and different groups of farmers if they are to deliver socially fair outcomes.},

abstract = {Innovation in agronomy by large numbers of smallholder farmers will need to accelerate if global commitments to end hunger are to be achieved in the face of major climate and other global change that are both caused by, and impact, agriculture. Conventional research and development in agronomy have involved a research process that produces technologies, which are then promoted for uptake by large numbers of farmers through extension, with both research and extension phases being more or less participatory. Recent research, including key contributions to this special issue, reveals that the performance of many technology options varies hugely across the geographies over which development programmes operate, depending on social, economic and ecological context. This severely limits the value of attempting to produce recommendations for large areas and numbers of farmers and identifies the need for new ways of supporting innovation that address the real-world heterogeneity of farmer circumstances. Addressing this widespread phenomenon of option by context interaction (OxC) has profound implications for how agronomic research and development are organised. Papers in this special issue show the nature and implications of such interactions and suggest ways in which research and development systems need to respond in order to support locally relevant innovation. It is evident that a paradigm shift is well underway, with researchers embracing new modes of thinking and action required to address OxC interactions, but these also need to be taken up and further developed by extension and change agents in the public and private sector. It is only through continued co-development of methods involving both these constituencies, working closely with farmers that sufficient progress is likely to be made for smallholder farming to keep pace with global demand for food without further damaging the environmental resources upon which production is based.},

abstract = {While the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) has been long considered a driving force behind the successes of the "Green Revolution", no prior study has attempted to develop an aggregate estimate of the value of the CGIAR System's impacts. However, economic ex post impact assessments have been conducted for some of the most outstanding individual innovations of the System. This study aggregates benefit estimates from specific technologies, and sets such against total investments in the CGIAR centers, so as to derive estimates for five different aggregate benefit-cost scenarios. Impact assessment has been pursued in a largely decentralized manner by individual research centers, and, as a result, methods and approaches differ among studies. Consequently, a critical review process was necessary for determining the reliability of individual impact estimates. A framework including two overarching principles for evaluating study reliability - (1) transparency and (2) demonstration of causality, as well as accordant criteria and indicators, was developed to assess individual estimates of economic impact before inclusion in scenarios of aggregate benefits. Against an aggregate investment of 7120 million 1990 US dollars, resultant benefit-cost ratios for research to date range from 1.9 to 17.3, depending on scenario. However, the true value of benefits arising from the CGIAR is probably in excess of even the upper bounds of these results, as only a small subset of System impacts have been quantified. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The papers herein revisit the issue of Boserupian agricultural intensification as an important response to land constraints, but they also go further than Boserup and her followers to explore broader responses to land constraints, including non-farm diversification, migration, and reduced fertility rates. Agricultural and rural development strategies in the region will need to more fully anticipate the implications of Africa's rapidly changing land and demographic situation, and the immense challenges that mounting land pressures pose in the context of current evidence of unsustainable agricultural intensification, a rapidly rising labor force associated with the region's current demographic conditions, and limited nonfarm job creation. These challenges are manageable but will require explicit policy actions to address the unique development challenges in densely populated rural areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Smallholder farming in much of Sub-Saharan Africa is rain-fed and thus exposed to rainfall variability. Among the climate variables, rainfall is projected to decline and have an overriding effect on crop productivity. With little opportunity for supplementary irrigation for the majority of farmers, a plausible strategy to maintain crop production under water-limited conditions includes balanced nutrient management for enhancing efficiency of use of limited soil water. Co-application of judicious rates of organic and mineral nutrient resources, particularly including the use of phosphorus (P) on P-limited soils, will facilitate development of an extensive crop rooting system for efficient exploration and capture of soil water, especially at a depth {\textgreater} 0.8 m. This chapter explores case studies across Eastern and Southern Africa where various soil water conservation and nutrient management approaches have been used to gain ‘extra miles' with limited available soil water. Firstly, an approach is described that varies nitrogen (N) fertilizer application across growing seasons, by adjusting N application rates to match current season rainfall trends. The approach offers opportunities for farmers to increase crop productivity to {\textgreater} 6tha  1 in high agro-potential areas, compared to a ceiling of 4.5 t ha  1 for the fixed fertilization model, while minimizing economic losses due to investments in N fertilizer during drought years. Secondly, we deal with the subject of fertilization across nutrient gradients, where a poor agronomic N use efficiency of {\textless} 18 kg grain kg  1 of applied N is demonstrated for soils with {\textless} 0.4 {\%} organic carbon, compared with {\textgreater} 35 kg grain kg  1 of N applied when soil organic carbon {\textgreater} 0.5 {\%}. Thirdly, the conservation agriculture (CA)-nutrient management nexus is examined, where maize yields in farmers' fields with CA alone were barely 0.5 t ha  1 compared to an average of 2.5 t ha  1 for CA combined with fertilizers. Fourthly, a novel system that involves intercropping two legumes with contrasting phenology for enhanced cropping system functioning is described. Finally, an approach that can be used for co-learning with farmers on soil fertility management principles for risk management is presented. The data lead to the conclusion that the ‘doubled-up' legumes system results in reduced fertilizer requirements for cereal crops grown in sequence, which benefits yield stability over time. Variable use of N fertilizer according to season quality and more tailored targeting of nutrients are vital for profitable investments in fertilizers in Africa. The Africa RISING project in Eastern and Southern Africa is currently harnessing some of these principles as vehicles for intensification of smallholder farming systems.},

Shorter maturity and efficient double and multiple cropping methods are needed to increase land productivity and intensity of labour use in areas of high population pressure and bimodal rainfall, i.e. mid-altitude zones. On the other hand, technologies that would lead to increased productivity of capital and higher response to external inputs are desired for the highlands of Kenya.

However, very little long-term evidence from farmers' fields, accounting for variations in agro-ecological conditions, has been assembled to back this claim or determine the conditions under which it is true. Using five waves of nationwide household survey data from Kenya covering 13. years, we estimate the relative and absolute profitability of nitrogen application rates on maize fields and compare these profitability conditions to observed nitrogen use patterns over time. In general, we find that farmers are consistently and steadily increasing towards risk-adjusted economically optimal rates of fertilizer application over time and that, in the most agriculturally productive areas, farmers' application rates on maize sometimes exceed rates that maximize profitability. Fertilizer use rates may nevertheless be profitably raised in these areas, but doing so will require the adoption of complementary inputs and management practices that raise maize response rates to fertilizer application. This motivates a more holistic approach to input intensification strategies in the region. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Farm typologies are a useful tool to assist in unpacking and understanding the wide diversity among smallholder farms to improve targeting of crop production intensification strategies. Sustainable crop production intensification will require the development of an array of nutrient management strategies tailored to farm-specific conditions, rather than blanket recommendations across diverse farms. This study reviewed key literature on smallholder farm typologies focusing on three countries (Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe), to gain insights on opportunities for crop production intensification, and the importance of developing farm-specific nutrient management practices. Investigations on farm typologies have done well in highlighting the fundamental differences between farm categories, with 3-5 typologies often adequate to represent the wide differences in resource endowment. Resource-endowed farmers have ready access to large quantities of manure and mineral fertilizers, which contribute to higher soil fertility and crop productivity on their farms. Resource-constrained households use little or no manure and mineral fertilizers, and have limited capacity to invest in labour-demanding soil fertility management technologies. These farmers often have to rely on off-farm opportunities for income that are largely limited to selling unskilled labour to their resource-endowed neighbors. The variability in management practices by farmers has resulted in three main soil fertility classes that can be used for targeting soil fertility management technologies, characterized by potential response to fertilizer application as: (1) low-responsive fertile fields that receive large additions of manure and fertilizer; (2) high-responsive infertile fields that receive moderate nutrient applications; (3) poorly responsive degraded soils cultivated for many years with little or no nutrient additions. The main conclusions drawn from the review are: (1) resource constrained farmers constitute the widest band across the three countries, with many of the farmers far below the threshold for sustainable maize production intensification and lacking capacity to invest in improved seed and fertilizer, (2) farm sizes and livestock ownership were key determinants for both farmer wealth status and farm productivity, and (3) soil organic carbon and available P were good indicators for predicting previous land management, that is also invariably linked to farmer resource endowment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This paper is the first in a series that reports on 17 years of systems research that used models differently from the Decision Support System idea that has dominated the field. The starting point of FARMSCAPE (Farmers', Advisers', Researchers', Monitoring, Simulation, Communication And Performance Evaluation) was finding whether farmers could value simulation when conditions for appreciation were improved by (a) specifying the simulator for individual paddocks in question and (b) delivering customised simulation to decision makers as a supporting service rather than software as a decision support product. The first aim of the program has been to learn how to effectively intervene in farm management practice using complex, abstract models of croplands, specified with local soil, climate, and management data. The second aim has been to learn how a resulting service that farmers value can be delivered cost effectively by a third party. This first paper deals with an aspect of the first aim, i.e. valued decision support intervention. In the terms used by Checkland (1981), the activities that served this systems practice aim were guided by 'what we thought we were doing' in intervening in farmers' practice, i.e. our systems thinking. This first paper concerns FARMSCAPE systems thinking and how it evolved over 17 years as we learned successively through discovery of a new concept or representation in the literature to overcome limitations of the then-current conceptual framework. Subsequent papers deal with customising scientific monitoring and simulation for farmers, communication as engagement in situations of practice, understanding decision support intervention as facilitation of personal knowledge construction, and piloting commercial delivery of a simulation-based service to farmers and their advisers. {\textcopyright} 2009 CSIRO.},

abstract = {80{\%} of arable land in Africa has low soil fertility and suffers from physical soil problems. Additionally, significant amounts of nutrients are lost every year due to unsustainable soil management practices. This is partially the result of insufficient use of soil management knowledge. To help bridge the soil information gap in Africa, the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project was established in 2008. Over the period 2008-2014, the AfSIS project compiled two point data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database and the AfSIS Sentinel Site database. These data sets contain over 28 thousand sampling locations and represent the most comprehensive soil sample data sets of the African continent to date. Utilizing these point data sets in combination with a large number of covariates, we have generated a series of spatial predictions of soil properties relevant to the agricultural management - organic carbon, pH, sand, silt and clay fractions, bulk density, cation-exchange capacity, total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, Al content and exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg, Na). We specifically investigate differences between two predictive approaches: random forests and linear regression. Results of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the random forests algorithm consistently outperforms the linear regression algorithm, with average decreases of 15-75{\%} in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across soil properties and depths. Fitting and running random forests models takes an order of magnitude more time and the modelling success is sensitive to artifacts in the input data, but as long as quality-controlled point data are provided, an increase in soil mapping accuracy can be expected. Results also indicate that globally predicted soil classes (USDA Soil Taxonomy, especially Alfisols and Mollisols) help improve continental scale soil property mapping, and are among the most important predictors. This indicates a promising potential for transferring pedological knowledge from data rich countries to countries with limited soil data.},

(2) Farmer seed networks are closed, conservative systems. (3) Farmer seed networks provide ready, egalitarian access to seed. (4) Farmer seed networks are destined to weaken and disappear. We challenge these misconceptions by drawing upon recent research findings and the authors' collective field experience in studying farmer seed systems in Africa, Europe, Latin America and Oceania. Priorities for future research are suggested that would advance our understanding of seed networks and better inform agricultural and food policy.},

abstract = {We calculated a simple indicator of food availability using data from 93 sites in 17 countries across contrasted agroecologies in sub-Saharan Africa ({\textgreater}13,000 farm households) and analyzed the drivers of variations in food availability. Crop production was the major source of energy, contributing 60{\%} of food availability. The off-farm income contribution to food availability ranged from 12{\%} for households without enough food available (18{\%} of the total sample) to 27{\%} for the 58{\%} of households with sufficient food available. Using only three explanatory variables (household size, number of livestock, and land area), we were able to predict correctly the agricultural determined status of food availability for 72{\%} of the households, but the relationships were strongly influenced by the degree of market access. Our analyses suggest that targeting poverty through improving market access and off-farm opportunities is a better strategy to increase food security than focusing on agricultural production and closing yield gaps. This calls for multisectoral policy harmonization, incentives, and diversification of employment sources rather than a singular focus on agricultural development. Recognizing and understanding diversity among smallholder farm households in sub-Saharan Africa is key for the design of policies that aim to improve food security.},

abstract = {Forest and woodland landscape restoration is a key undertaking of renewed interest for forestry and conservation practitioners, but is hampered by the lack of information on the distributions of tree species and of patterns of intra-specific genetic variation. Through the first meta-analysis of its type, we here tested the utility of a high-resolution potential natural vegetation (PNV) map for eastern Africa (vegetationmap4africa) for supporting restoration activities by comparison with 20 molecular marker genetic datasets, identified through literature review and other sources, for ten indigenous tree species. Our analysis indicated that site suitability and stability values from PNV-based ecological niche modelling involving current and past climate scenarios were positively related to population genetic diversity values revealed by molecular markers, supporting the value of PNV maps for the practical planning of restoration activities accounting for anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore, population pairwise genetic divergence was strongly positively correlated with population pairwise geographic distances for most datasets, indicating generalizable sampling implications for tree genetic resource conservation in the region. Population pairwise genetic divergence was however not well explained by sampling across PNV and wider physiognomic types, possibly due to molecular markers' adaptive neutrality and high rates of recombination in trees, among other factors. Patterns of neutral molecular marker variation are thus no substitute for trials of adaptive variation for confirming or refuting the utility of vegetation boundaries in defining tree planting zones. We discuss the importance of results for eastern Africa and more widely.},

abstract = {Yield gap analysis is gaining increased scientific attention, as estimating and explaining yield gaps shows the potential for sustainable intensification of agricultural systems. Explaining yield gaps requires detailed information about the biophysical environment, crop management as well as farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic conditions in which farmers operate. However, these types of data are not always available, mostly because they are costly to collect. The main objective of this research is to assess data availability and data collection approaches for yield gap analysis, and to summarize the yield gap explaining factors identified by previous studies. For this purpose, a review of yield gap studies (50 agronomic-based peer-reviewed articles) was performed to identify the most commonly considered and explaining factors of the yield gap. Besides a global comparison, differences between regions, crops and methods were analysed as well. The results show that management and edaphic factors are more often considered to explain the yield gap compared to farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic factors. However, when considered, both farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic factors often explain the yield gap. Fertilization and soil fertility factors are the most often considered management and edaphic factors. In the fertilization group, factors related to quantity (e.g. N fertilizer quantity) are more often considered compared to factors related to timing (e.g. N fertilizer timing). However, when considered, timing explained the yield gap more often. Explaining factors vary among regions and crops. For example, while soil fertility is considered relatively much both in Africa and Asia, it is often explaining in Africa, but not in Asia. Agronomic methods like crop growth simulation models are often used for yield gap analysis, but are limited in the type and number of factors that can be included. Qualitative methods based on expert knowledge can include the largest range of factors. Although the data included in yield gap analysis also depends on the objective, knowledge of explaining factors, and methods applied, data availability is a major limiting factor. Bottom-up data collection approaches (e.g. crowdsourcing) involving agricultural communities can provide alternatives to overcome this limitation and improve yield gap analysis.},

This complexity peaks in semi-arid regions of India, where small farms encounter a highly competitive environment for markets and resources, especially unreliable access to water from rainfall and irrigation. To represent such strategies, we propose the conceptual model NAMASTE, which was conceived and based on data collected in the Berambadi watershed in southern India. The most relevant and novel aspects of NAMASTE are i) the system-based representation of farm production systems, ii) the description of dynamic processes through management flexibility and adaptation, and iii) the representation of steps in farmers' decision-making processes at various temporal and spatial scales. Since NAMASTE was designed in an extreme case of highly vulnerable agriculture, its generic framework and formalisms can be used to conceptually represent many other farm production systems.},

abstract = {Precision Agriculture (PA) can help in managing crop production inputs in an environmentally friendly way. By using site-specific knowledge, PA can target rates of fertilizer, seed and chemicals for soil and other conditions. PA substitutes information and knowledge for physical inputs. A literature review indicates PA can contribute in many ways to long-term sustainability of production agriculture, confirming the intuitive idea that PA should reduce environmental loading by applying fertilizers and pesticides only where they are needed, and when they are needed. Precision agriculture benefits to the environment come from more targeted use of inputs that reduce losses from excess applications and from reduction of losses due to nutrient imbalances, weed escapes, insect damage, etc. Other benefits include a reduction in pesticide resistance development. One limitation of the papers reviewed is that only a few actually measured directly environmental indices, such as leaching with the use of soil sensors. Most of them estimated indirectly the environmental benefits by measuring the reduced chemical loading. Results from an on-farm trial in Argentina provide an example of how site-specific information and variable rate application could be used in maintaining profitability while reducing N applications. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that PA is a modestly more profitable alternative than whole field management, for a wide range of restrictions on N application levels. These restrictions might be government regulations or the landowner's understanding of environmental stewardship. In the example, variable rate of N maintains farm profitability even when nitrogen is restricted to less than half of the recommended uniform rate.},

abstract = {Mineral nturient defiencies are a major constraint limiting legume nitrogen fixation and yield. In this review general techniques for assessing nutrient involvement in symbiotic nitrogen fixation are described and specific methods are outlined for determining which developmental phase of the symbiosis is most sensitive to nutrient deficiency. The mineral nutrition of the Rhizobium component of the symbiosis is considered both as the free living organism in the soil and as bacteroids in root nodules. Rhizobial growth and survival in soils is not usually limited by nutrient availability. Multiplication of rhizobia in the legume rhizosphere is limited by low Ca availability. Nodule initiation is affected by severe Co deficiency through effects on rhizobia. Nodule development is limited by severe B deficiency via an effect on plant cell growth. Fe deficiency limits nodule development by affecting rhizobia and strains of rhizobia differ widely in their ability to acquire sufficient Fe for their symbiotic development. Nodule function requires more Mo than does the host plant, and in some symbioses nitrogen fixation may be specifically limited by low availability of Ca, Co, Cu and Fe. The importance of the peribacteriod membrane in determining nutrient availability to bacteroids is considered. It is concluded that the whole legume-Rhizobium symbiosis should be considered when improving legume growth and yield under nutrient stress conditions. Differences among rhizobial strains in their ability to obtain mineral nutrients from their environment may be agronomically important. {\textcopyright} 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Baobab populations have been showing a lack of regeneration, and therefore causes concern for the species survival. This study investigated the state, distribution and use of baobabs in an under-researched population in Kenya, to identify the potential for further use and development of baobab resources. A baobab population was chosen in Taita–Taveta County, covering a sample area of 2015 km2. A systematic stratified transect survey was done to map baobab distribution using 49 transects (0.5 × 3 km each). The diameter at breast height and other indicators were measured on all baobabs in the transects to assess population status and health. A household survey (n = 46) and focus group discussions (n = 12) were done following the transect survey to gain an idea on the uses and distribution of baobab. In total, 432 baobab trees were measured and recorded in the research area of 2015 km2. The baobabs grew in two clusters (i.e., areas with a baobab density of ≥0.08 baobabs/ha). Both clusters showed rejuvenating populations. The main factors identified by the respondents, positively and negatively influencing baobab distribution were environmental factors, wildlife, human impact and commercial value. The study area shows a great potential for baobab to become an important part of the diet, due to its current use as an emergency food during food scarce times, and the relatively healthy and stable rejuvenating populations.},

abstract = {This paper provides an insight on the use of various participatory approaches to develop ICTs to the rural farming communities. The paper shows how collective groups of farmers can be empowered through involvement of different stakeholders in a participatory action research. The paper also discusses how participatory action research will help the farming community in adopting ICT-based solutions for agriculture. This in turn will contribute in solving problems as well as assisting decision making in identifying technological and agricultural needs. In this study, a total of 64 researchers and extension workers and 320 rural farmers were involved. Primary data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and interviews. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics tool. The results indicate that many ICT- based solutions for agriculture are not adopted by farmers and other stakeholders in various agricultural value chains because those ICTs were developed without using participatory approaches. Moreover, the results from study indicate that participatory action research approaches such as Participatory Communication (PV), Participatory Video (PV), Participatory Learning and Action Research (PLAR), Farmer Participatory Research (FPR), Informal-Mobile Learning Research (IMLR) have a significant impact on the effective use of ICTs in rural farming community and the agricultural domain in general. Among of these participatory approaches, the IMLR and PLAR have shown to be more effective because of availability and interactive mobile learning environments that excite interests, commitments and encourages participatory attitudes among famers and researchers. This study provides an evident that ICTs has a dominant position to alleviate rural poverty and strengthen the agriculture productivity through participatory approaches. We recommend that a strong commitment of all actors in agriculture value chain is needed so that they can collaborate to identify the problem, analysis and design possible solutions and finally, implement and later on use those developed ICTs to increase agriculture productivity.},

abstract = {Recent advances in ecological modeling have focused on novel methods for characterizing the environment that use presence-only data and machine-learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of species occurrence. These novel methods may have great potential for land suitability applications in the developing world where detailed land cover information is often unavailable or incomplete. This paper assesses the adaptation and application of the presence-only geographic species distribution model, MaxEnt, for agricultural crop suitability mapping in a rural Thailand where lowland paddy rice and upland field crops predominant. To assess this modeling approach, three independent crop presence datasets were used including a social-demographic survey of farm households, a remote sensing classification of land use/land cover, and ground control points, used for geodetic and thematic reference that vary in their geographic distribution and sample size. Disparate environmental data were integrated to characterize environmental settings across Nang Rong District, a region of approximately 1300. sq. km in size. Results indicate that the MaxEnt model is capable of modeling crop suitability for upland and lowland crops, including rice varieties, although model results varied between datasets due to the high sensitivity of the model to the distribution of observed crop locations in geographic and environmental space. Accuracy assessments indicate that model outcomes were influenced by the sample size and the distribution of sample points in geographic and environmental space. The need for further research into accuracy assessments of presence-only models lacking true absence data is discussed. We conclude that the MaxEnt model can provide good estimates of crop suitability, but many areas need to be carefully scrutinized including geographic distribution of input data and assessment methods to ensure realistic modeling results. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

But how can these global generalizations be used for evidence-based decision making at the local scale, if only the local evidence is perceived to be relevant to a local decision? We show how an interactive method of meta-analysis — dynamic meta-analysis — can be used to assess the local relevance of global evidence. We developed Metadataset (www.metadataset.com) as an example of dynamic meta-analysis. Using Metadataset, we show how evidence can be filtered and weighted, and results can be recalculated, using dynamic methods of subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and recalibration. With an example from agroecology, we show how dynamic meta-analysis could lead to different conclusions for different subsets of the global evidence. Dynamic meta-analysis could also lead to a rebalancing of power and responsibility in evidence synthesis, since evidence users would be able to make decisions that are typically made by systematic reviewers — decisions about which studies to include (e.g., critical appraisal) and how to handle missing or poorly reported data (e.g., sensitivity analysis). We suggest that dynamic meta-analysis could be scaled up and used for subject-wide evidence synthesis in several scientific disciplines (e.g., agroecology and conservation biology). However, the metadata that are used to filter and weight the evidence would need to be standardized within disciplines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of literature on the residual effects of grain legumes in cereal-based systems of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to quantify the magnitude and variability of rotational effects, to explore the importance of environmental and management factors in determining variability and to evaluate the evidence of the different mechanisms that explain rotational effects. We retrieved 44 unique publications providing 199 observations comparing continuous cereal performance with that of a grain legume-cereal rotation. The overall mean yield increase of 0.49 t grain ha−1, equal to an increase of 41{\%} of the continuous cereal yield, is highly significant, but the variability in residual effects is large. Effects were more pronounced in southern Africa, the highlands of East Africa and the Guinea savannah, and less in the humid forest/derived savannah of West Africa and the Sudano-Sahelian zone. Maize showed stronger yield responses after a legume than millet and sorghum. Agro-ecological zone and cereal type were however confounded. All grain legume types significantly improved cereal yields, with stronger residual effects observed after soybean and groundnut than after cowpea. Fertiliser N application to cereals reduces the residual effects of legumes, but the response at 60–120 kg N ha−1 still equalled 0.32 t ha−1 or 59{\%} of the response when no N is applied. The sustained benefits with large N applications indicate the importance of non-N effects. While mechanisms for improved soil P availability after grain legumes have been studied in some detail, it remains uncertain how important these are in farmers' fields. Grain legumes are unlikely to have a major influence on the availability of nutrients other than N and P, or on soil pH. Beneficial impacts of grain legumes on soil organic matter content can occur if legumes contribute to a greater overall cropping productivity, but studies generally report no such impacts. Evidence of impacts of grain legumes on weeds is limited to striga. Studies on the impacts on nematode pressure in cereals are inconclusive, probably because legumes act as a host for some of the key nematode genera that harm maize. The impact on the pressure of other pests and diseases in cereals is probably important, but evidence on this from SSA is lacking. Future research on N2-fixation by grain legumes and residual N benefits should focus on explaining the wide variability observed among sites. There is a clear need for more detailed mechanistic studies to assess the occurrence and relevance of non-N effects of grain legumes, particularly in relation to common pests and diseases in cereals.},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Africa recognise the important role of manure in maintaining soil fertility. For smallholder farmers who use little fertiliser, efficient management of nutrients in manure is key for crop production. We describe a simple model to analyse the effect of manure management on the efficiency of mass and nutrient retention. We used on-farm data on manure excreted and manure management, experimental results, literature and fuzzy logic to model losses during manure storage. The model was used to analyse N cycling efficiency (NCE) within smallholder farms in western Kenya. Simulations showed that manure management during collection and storage had a large effect on the efficiency of C and nutrient retention. Differences in NCE between farmers of different wealth classes arose due to differences in resource endowment. For poorer farmers, large N losses occur at all stages of manure recycling. Urinary-N losses occurred on all farms but their impact on NCE for poor and medium-class farmers was larger due to the smaller amount of N recycled. With current management the poor farmer recovered {\textless} 1 kg N y- 1 in composted manure from 15 kg N y- 1 excreted. Improved manure storage had little effect on increasing overall NCE for the poor farmer due to large losses before storage. For the wealthier farmer improvement of manure storage increased NCE and allowed recycling of 30{\%} of N excreted (ca. 30 kg N y- 1) with small investment in infrastructure. Covering manure heaps with a polythene film reduced mass and N losses considerably. For the poor to increase overall NCE, investment in cattle housing and recycling of urinary-N is required. Increasing cattle numbers or improved feeding would have a larger effect on manure availability but this is constrained by feed scarcity and investment capacity. The absolute amounts of N recycled (1-6, 4-17 and 7-18 kg N y- 1 for poor, medium and wealthier farmers) were small compared with maize N demand ({\textgreater} 50 kg N ha- 1), but significant given the small farm sizes (0.1-1.1 ha). Although absolute amounts of N recycled with improved manure management may have little immediate impact on crop productivity, manure is often the only input available. Manure provides other nutrients for crops and maintains soil organic matter - both vital to guarantee efficient use of fertiliser N - which justifies the search for interventions to assist farmers make better use of manure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although global food demand is expected to increase 60{\%} by 2050 compared with 2005/2007, the rise will be much greater in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Indeed, SSA is the region at greatest food security risk because by 2050 its population will increase 2.5-fold and demand for cereals approximately triple, whereas current levels of cereal consumption already depend on substantial imports. At issue is whether SSA can meet this vast increase in cereal demand without greater reliance on cereal imports or major expansion of agricultural area and associated biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies indicate that the global increase in food demand by 2050 can be met through closing the gap between current farm yield and yield potential on existing cropland. Here, however, we estimate it will not be feasible to meet future SSA cereal demand on existing production area by yield gap closure alone. Our agronomically robust yield gap analysis for 10 countries in SSA using location-specific data and a spatial upscaling approach reveals that, in addition to yield gap closure, other more complex and uncertain components of intensification are also needed, i.e., increasing cropping intensity (the number of crops grown per 12mo on the same field) and sustainable expansion of irrigated production area. If intensification is not successful and massive cropland land expansion is to be avoided, SSA will depend much more on imports of cereals than it does today.},

However, there are likely to be broader implications arising from the digitalisation of agricultural innovation systems. Agricultural knowledge and advice networks are important components of agricultural innovation systems that have the potential to be digitally disrupted. In this paper, we review trends within agricultural knowledge and advice networks both internationally and in Australia, to anticipate and prepare for potential transformations in these networks. Through a combined structured and traditional review of relevant literature, we come to three key conclusions regarding the state-of-the-art. First, the connectivity of humans and technologies in agricultural knowledge and advice networks and value chains will likely continue to increase. Second, transparency of agricultural practices and informational interaction between farmers, advisors, agri-businesses, consumers and regulators will drive and be driven by growing connectivity. Finally, there are likely to be challenges balancing the priorities of various agricultural stakeholders as agricultural innovation systems digitalise. These findings have implications for the oversight of international agri-food sectors.},

abstract = {The improved grain yield per unit area of modern maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids is due to the increased optimum plant population rather than the improved grain yield per plant. Traits associated with tolerance to various stresses, including high plant populations, and the efficiency of capture and use of resources rendered modern hybrids more productive. As a consequence of the improved tolerance to high plant populations and the low yield potential per plant, modern hybrids are strongly population-dependent as their maximum grain yield is achieved only under a narrow spectrum of high plant populations, followed by adverse effects on hybrids' productivity and stability. Missing plants and unevenness in the plant emergence constitute common problems in the field. Grain yield loss due to missing plants is poorly compensated by the increased yield of the surrounding plants, so grain yield per unit area decreases. Unevenness in the plant emergence leads to increased plant-to-plant variability, the impact being stronger under higher plant populations. Plant-to-plant variability is associated with decreased resource use efficiency, and therefore with reduced grain yield. At higher plant populations reduced grain yield also results from the increased pollen-to-silking interval and the following barrenness. Consequently, maize breeding should seek hybrids that combine population-tolerance and improved yield potential per plant, so that a wider range of optimum plant populations insure both high productivity and stable performance. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Agricultural intensification has resulted in a simplification of agricultural landscapes by the expansion of agricultural land, enlargement of field size and removal of non-crop habitat. These changes are considered to be an important cause of the rapid decline in farmland biodiversity, with the remaining biodiversity concentrated in field edges and non-crop habitats. The simplification of landscape composition and the decline of biodiversity may affect the functioning of natural pest control because non-crop habitats provide requisites for a broad spectrum of natural enemies, and the exchange of natural enemies between crop and non-crop habitats is likely to be diminished in landscapes dominated by arable cropland. In this review, we test the hypothesis that natural pest control is enhanced in complex patchy landscapes with a high proportion of non-crop habitats as compared to simple large-scale landscapes with little associated non-crop habitat. In 74{\%} and 45{\%} of the studies reviewed, respectively, natural enemy populations were higher and pest pressure lower in complex landscapes versus simple landscapes. Landscape-driven pest suppression may result in lower crop injury, although this has rarely been documented. Enhanced natural enemy activity was associated with herbaceous habitats in 80{\%} of the cases (e.g. fallows, field margins), and somewhat less often with wooded habitats (71{\%}) and landscape patchiness (70{\%}). The similar contributions of these landscape factors suggest that all are equally important in enhancing natural enemy populations. We conclude that diversified landscapes hold most potential for the conservation of biodiversity and sustaining the pest control function. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, "Random Forest" estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at ∼100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

abstract = {Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.},

abstract = {Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in environmental sciences.},

While these changes will influence agriculture at a broad scale, regional or country-level assessments can miss critical detail. We use high-resolution methods to generate characteristic daily weather data for a combination of different future emission scenarios and climate models to drive detailed simulation models of the maize and bean crops. For the East African region, there is considerable spatial and temporal variation in this crop response. We evaluate the response of maize and beans to a changing climate, as a prelude to detailed targeting of options that can help smallholder households adapt. The results argue strongly against the idea of large, spatially contiguous development domains for identifying and implementing adaptation options, particularly in regions with large variations in topography and current average temperatures. Rather, they underline the importance of localised, community-based efforts to increase local adaptive capacity, take advantage of changes that may lead to increased crop and livestock productivity where this is possible, and to buffer the situations where increased stresses are likely. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fertiliser application strategies for maize (Zeamays L.) production on sandy soils under high rainfall regimes need to be carefully designed to minimise nutrient losses through leaching and maximise crop yield. Experiments were conducted to determine N, P, and K leaching in sandy soils with 3-6{\%} clay in surface layers under maize production, and the effectiveness of different N, P, and K fertiliser timing and splitting strategies on leaching of N, P, and K and on maize yield. In a column experiment on an Oxic Paleustult (Korat series) with 3{\%} clay, leaching of N, P, and K from fertiliser (114N-17P-22K in kg ha-1) was significant under simulated rainfall, but decreased to negligible levels with 3-5 split applications of fertiliser. Maize N and K uptake increased with 3-5 split applications, but not P uptake. Despite continued intense rainfall and further fertilizer additions, leaching was not recorded after day 30, and this was attributed to the effect of plant water uptake on reducing deep drainage. Split applications of fertilizer maintained NP and K in the 0-30 cm layer during 30-60 days when maize nutrient demand was likely to be at its highest, while in the recommended fertilizer regime NPK in the surface layers declined after 30 days. In a field experiment on an Oxic Paleustult (Korat series) with 6{\%} clay, 3-4 splits of fertiliser increased N and K uptake and increased maize yields from 3.3 to 4.5 Mg ha-1. Postponing basal fertiliser application from pre-planting to 7-15 days after emergence increased uptake of N, P, and K and grain yield emphasising the greater risk of nutrient losses from fertiliser applied at planting than later. Strategies designed to reduce the amount of nutrients applied as fertiliser at planting, such as split application and postponing basal application can decrease the risk of leaching of N, P, and K from fertiliser and improve nutrient use efficiency, and grain yield of maize on sandy soils under high growing season rainfall regimes. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {Strong gradients of decreasing soil fertility are found with increasing distance from the homestead within smallholder African farms, due to differential resource allocation. As nutrient use efficiency varies strongly along these gradients, such heterogeneity must be considered when designing soil management strategies, aimed at an improved overall resource use efficiency at farm scale. Here, we quantify the magnitude and study the origin of farmer-induced, within-farm soil fertility gradients as affected by biophysical and socio-economic conditions, and investigate farmers' perceptions of such heterogeneity. Farm transects, participatory resource flow mapping, farmers' classification of land qualities, and soil sampling for both chemical and spectral reflectance analyses were performed across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka) representing the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Differences between the various field types of a farm were observed for input use (e.g. 0.7-104 kg N ha-1), food production (e.g. 0.6-2.9 t DM ha-1), partial C (e.g. -570 to 1480 kg ha-1) and N (e.g. -92 to 57 kg ha-1) balances and general soil fertility status, despite strong differences across sub-locations. Concentration of nutrients in the home fields compared with the remote fields were verified for extractable P (e.g. 2.1-19.8 mg kg-1) and secondarily for exchangeable K (e.g. 0.14-0.54 cmol(+) kg -1), on average, whereas differences for soil C and N were only important when considering each individual farm separately. Farmers managed their fields according to their perceived land quality, varying the timing and intensity of management practices along soil fertility gradients. Fields classified by them as poor were planted later (up to 33.6 days of delay), with sparser crops (ca. 30{\%} less plants m-2) and had higher weed infestation levels than those classified as fertile, leading to important differences in maize yield (e.g. 0.9 versus 2.4 t ha-1). The internal heterogeneity in resource allocation varied also between farms of different social classes, according to their objectives and factor constraints. Additionally, the interaction of sub-location-specific socio-economic (population, markets) and biophysical factors (soilscape variability) determined the patterns of resource allocation to different activities. Such interactions need to be considered for the characterisation of farming system to facilitate targeting research and development interventions to address the problem of poor soil fertility. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Replacing coffee with cocoa and integrating trees in combined agroforestry systems to ameliorate abiotic stress are among the proposed alternatives to overcome this challenge. These two alternatives do not consider the vulnerability of cocoa and tree species commonly used in agroforestry plantations to future climate conditions. We assessed the suitability of these alternatives by identifying the potential changes in the distribution of coffee, cocoa and the 100 most common agroforestry trees found in Mesoamerica. Here we show that cocoa could potentially become an alternative in most of coffee vulnerable areas. Agroforestry with currently preferred tree species is highly vulnerable to future climate change. Transforming agroforestry systems by changing tree species composition may be the best approach to adapt most of the coffee and cocoa production areas. Our results stress the urgency for land use planning considering climate change effects and to assess new combinations of agroforestry species in coffee and cocoa plantations in Mesoamerica.},

abstract = {A study was conducted in the sub-humid Kiambu and in the semi-arid Mbeere districts of Kenya to determine smallholder farmers' manure management practices and quantity and quality of on-farm available manure under different livestock management systems. Data collected from 60 smallholder farmers identified manure management practices to be variable and poor irrespective of management system. The quality of cattle manure in the open grazing systems of Mbeere was poorer (1.22{\%} N; 0.09{\%} P; 2.14{\%} K) and of higher variability than manures from zero-grazing systems of Kiambu (1.41{\%} N; 0.53{\%} P; 1.54{\%} K) where animals are supplied with high quality feed supplements. We calculated the potential manure production to be 3.1 and 0.7 tonnes DM year-1 farm-1 for Kiambu and Mbeere, respectively. Faced with low manure availability, farmers adopted manure management strategies that included accumulation in livestock pens and or removal from livestock pens and storing over time before spatial and temporal application to selected crops and plots in a rotational pattern. In both study sites, the sole application of manure or inorganic fertilizers proved limited in providing a comprehensive solution to crop nutrient supply. Given this limitation and the differential farmer resource endowments in sub-humid and semi-arid study sites, appropriate strategies for improving manure storage, quantity and quality, efficient manure use and application methods and integrated soil fertility management need to be developed, separately for each livestock management system, to enhance crop nutrient supply. {\textcopyright} 2008 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract = {A sufficient intake of fruits can alleviate micronutrient deficiencies and reduces the risks of a number of associated diseases. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, however, the production and consumption of fruits are inadequate on average and in particular so in specific seasons. To better incorporate fruits into local food systems while addressing the challenge of seasonal availability, World Agroforestry (ICRAF) has developed a methodology based on “fruit tree portfolios” that selects socio-ecologically suitable and nutritionally important fruit tree species for farm production, to meet local consumption needs. We here present this approach and illustrate it with data from a case study involving Western and Eastern Kenya. The approach uses mixed methods to capture on-farm fruit tree diversity and seasonality at a household level (n = 600 in our case study), the months of household's food security and insecurity (n = 600) and food consumption patterns at an individual level, to identify dietary gaps (n = 294 women and child pairs in our example). In our case study, 31 fruit tree species were reported on farms in our Western Kenya sample (9 of which were indigenous) and 51 (27 indigenous) in Eastern Kenya. In addition, the median number of food-insecure months per household was four (ranging from 0 to 9 months) in Eastern Kenya and three (0 to 12 months) in Western Kenya. Finally, using 24-h recalls the proportion of women that had consumed a fruit the day before the interview was around 55{\%} in Western Kenya and 80{\%} in Eastern Kenya, with consumption averaging 93 and 131 g, respectively. Using these parameters for each site and fruit tree phenology and food composition data sets, we derived context-specific recommendations that involve promoting 11 fruit tree species to address micronutrient gaps.},

This study evaluated mulching maize stover, intercropping maize with soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and desmodium (Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb.), and integration of mulching and intercropping for their effectiveness in reducing damage of Microtermes spp mainly Microtermes vadschaggae Sjostedt and Microtermes adschaggae (Sjosted) to maize. Five termite management treatments and a control (sole maize) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates on 2 farm sites in 2016 and 7 sites in 2017 cropping seasons in Sibu Sire and Gudeya Billa. Results indicated that application of maize stover as mulch combined with animal manure, maize-soybean intercrops and wood ash, maize-desmodium intercrops, and mulching combined with maize-soybean intercrops consistently reduced termite damage to maize in both cropping seasons. These results were comparable to application of Diazinon 60{\%} EC (standard check). In addition, intercropping maize with desmodium, mulching + intercropping maize with soybean, and Diazinon 60{\%} EC reduced the number of lodged plants per plot compared to control. Maize grain yield in treated plots was significantly higher than maize monocrop control. In order to reduce termite damage and to enhance maize productivity, mulching using maize stover, and intercropping of maize with soybean or desmodium can be used in termite prone areas of western Ethiopia and other countries in Africa with similar agroecologies.},

With food shortages and increased threats of climate change, interest in agroforestry is gathering for its potential to address various on-farm adaptation needs, and fulfill many roles in AFOLU-related mitigation pathways. Agroforestry provides assets and income from carbon, wood energy, improved soil fertility and enhancement of local climate conditions; it provides ecosystem services and reduces human impacts on natural forests. Most of these benefits have direct benefits for local adaptation while contributing to global efforts to control atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

abstract = {Current efforts in combating food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) focus on agricultural intensification. Given the high soil nutrient depletions, replenishing soil fertility is a major component of such efforts. One of the key nutrients limiting crop production is phosphorus (P). Overcoming P deficiency in smallholder farming in SSA faces many challenges, mainly because the causes of P deficiencies vary, and viable options to replenish soil P have limitations. In some areas, P deficiency is associated with a low P reserve, while in others, it results from a high soil P-adsorption capacity. Numerous studies have focused on developing approaches and strategies with potential to replenish soil P or improve its availability to crops. This paper highlights approaches and strategies that have been studied, including the use of soluble P fertilizers, phosphate rocks and organic resources. The contribution of soluble P fertilizers is mainly limited by their high cost, while most phosphate rocks are not mined. Replenishing P through organic resources is constrained by their often low P content and inadequate availability in smallholder farms. Optimizing the P use efficiency appears as the most plausible target pending an increased accessibility of P sources to farmers. Practices towards this optimization include strategic crop sequences and P allocation to crops, use of P-efficient genotypes, and targeting the residual P. Research is needed towards gaps in understanding processes governing benefits associated with these practices. Since P replenishment is fertilizer dependent, greater attention is required in enhancing the accessibility of P fertilizers to smallholder farmers.},

abstract = {Despite significant efforts in agriculture market development, millions of smallholder farmers remain isolated from markets, due to remoteness and low farm productivity. Push/ pull approaches to market development suggest a dual strategy for bringing smallholders into agricultural markets: 1) reduce producer vulnerability and build capacities, based on market requirements; and 2) facilitate relationships for producers to deal in consistent, growing markets. While simple in concept and effective as an approach, the execution of push/pull is complex. In particular, it is difficult to connect push (producer capacity) and pull (market) elements, resulting in unsustainable market linkages. When applying a push/ pull approach in areas where the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) works, AKF has noted that local entrepreneurs can link push and pull effectively and for the long term. This case study reviews how entrepreneurs link push and pull in AKF's market development programme in southern Tanzania. It outlines learning on how local entrepreneurs bridge gaps between producers and firms, taking the case of remote farmers accessing inputs (seed, fertilizer, implements, and pesticide) from larger suppliers. The paper describes the challenge of linking push and pull, outlines AKF's experience in southern Tanzania, and follows with points for discussion on incorporating local entrepreneurs into push/pull programmes.

abstract = {Agriculture is in crisis. Soil health is collapsing. Biodiversity faces the sixth mass extinction. Crop yields are plateauing. Against this crisis narrative swells a clarion call for Regenerative Agriculture. But what is Regenerative Agriculture, and why is it gaining such prominence? Which problems does it solve, and how? Here we address these questions from an agronomic perspective. The term Regenerative Agriculture has actually been in use for some time, but there has been a resurgence of interest over the past 5 years. It is supported from what are often considered opposite poles of the debate on agriculture and food. Regenerative Agriculture has been promoted strongly by civil society and NGOs as well as by many of the major multi-national food companies. Many practices promoted as regenerative, including crop residue retention, cover cropping and reduced tillage are central to the canon of ‘good agricultural practices', while others are contested and at best niche (e.g. permaculture, holistic grazing). Worryingly, these practices are generally promoted with little regard to context. Practices most often encouraged (such as no tillage, no pesticides or no external nutrient inputs) are unlikely to lead to the benefits claimed in all places. We argue that the resurgence of interest in Regenerative Agriculture represents a re-framing of what have been considered to be two contrasting approaches to agricultural futures, namely agroecology and sustainable intensification, under the same banner. This is more likely to confuse than to clarify the public debate. More importantly, it draws attention away from more fundamental challenges. We conclude by providing guidance for research agronomists who want to engage with Regenerative Agriculture.},

abstract = {Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are highly diverse and heterogeneous, often operating in complex socio-ecological environments. Much of the heterogeneity within the farming systems is caused by spatial soil variability, which results in its turn from the interaction between inherent soil/landscape variability and human agency through the history of management of different fields. Technologies and resources designed to improve crop productivity often generate weak responses in the poorest fields of smallholder farms. Thus, options for soil fertility improvement must be targeted strategically within heterogeneous farming systems to ensure their effectiveness and propensity to enhance the efficiency of resource (e.g. land, labour and nutrients) use at farm scale. Key issues in design of approaches for strategic targeting of resources include (1) inherent soil variability across agroecological gradients; (2) social diversity, farmers' production orientations and livelihood strategies; (3) farmer-induced gradients of soil fertility, their causes and consequences of efficient allocation of scarce resources; (4) competing objectives and trade-offs that farmers face between immediate production goals and long-term sustainability and (5) the complexity of farmers' own indicators of success. We used an analytical framework in which systems analysis is aided by survey, experiments and simulation modelling to analyse farming futures in the highlands of East Africa. Our work contributes to the development of ‘best-fit' or tailor-made technologies, using combinations of mineral fertilizers and organic matter management from N2-fixing legumes and animal manures. Thus, we hope to contribute to the design of a ‘uniquely African green revolution' called for by UN Director General Kofi Annan, which fits technology interventions to the diverse and heterogeneous smallholder farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa.},

The framework is used to examine several extension modalities and to analyze their likely and actual effectiveness. Specifically, the modalities reviewed include "training and visit" extension, decentralized systems, "fee-for-service" and privatized extension, and farmer-field-schools. The chapter also provides a discussion of methodological issues pertaining to the assessment of extension outcomes, and a review of some of the recent empirical literature on extension impact. The chapter emphasizes the efficiency gains that can come from locally decentralized delivery systems with incentive structures based on largely private provision that in most countries will still be publicly funded. In wealthier countries, and for particular higher income farmer groups, extension systems will likely evolve into fee-for-service organizations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here weconduct a globalmeta-analysis using 5,463 paired yield observations from610 studies to compare no-till, the original and central concept of conservation agriculture, with conventional tillage practices across 48 crops and 63 countries. Overall, our results show that no-till reduces yields, yet this response is variable and under certain conditions no-till can produce equivalent or greater yields than conventional tillage. Importantly,whenno-till is combined with the other two conservation agriculture principles of residue retention and crop rotation, its negative impacts are minimized. Moreover, no-till in combination with the other two principles significantly increases rainfed cropproductivity indry climates, suggesting that itmaybecome animportant climate-change adaptation strategy for ever-drier regions of the world. However, any expansion of conservation agriculture should be done with caution in these areas, as implementation of the other two principles is often challenging in resource-poor and vulnerable smallholder farming systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of yield losses rather than gains. Although farming systems are multifunctional, and environmental and socio-economic factors need to be considered14-16, our analysis indicates that the potential contribution of no-till to the sustainable intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed.},

We obtained spatial confinement below size of the Bohr radius for proton spin chain FWHM. Precise manipulation of individual spins and polarization of electron spin states are analyzed via proton induced emission and controlled population of energy shells in pure 29Si nanocrystal. Entangled quantum states of channeled proton trajectories are mapped in transverse and angular phase space of 29Si axial channel alignment in order to avoid transversal excitations. Proton density and proton energy as impact parameter functions are characterized in single particle density matrix via discretization of diagonal and nearest off-diagonal elements. We combined high field and low densities (1 MeV/92 nm) to create inseparable quantum state by superimposing the hyperpolarizationed proton spin chain with electron spin of 29Si. Quantum discretization of density of states (DOS) was performed by the Monte Carlo simulation method using numerical solutions of proton equations of motion. Distribution of gaussian coherent states is obtained by continuous modulation of individual spin phase and amplitude. Obtained results allow precise engineering and faithful mapping of spin states. This would provide the effective quantum key distribution (QKD) and transmission of quantum information over remote distances between quantum memory centers for scalable quantum communication network. Furthermore, obtained results give insights in application of channeled protons subatomic microscopy as a complete versatile scanning-probe system capable of both quantum engineering of charged particle states and characterization of quantum states below diffraction limit linear and in-depth resolution.},

Under complete and competitive markets, households can solve their consumption and production problems separately, so that household factor endowments do not predict input demand. This paper implements a simple, theoretically grounded test of this separation hypothesis, which can be interpreted as a reduced form test of market failure. In all five study countries, the analysis finds strong evidence of factor market failure. Moreover, those failures appear general and structural, not specific to subpopulations defined by gender, geography, human capital, or land quality. However, we show that rural markets are not generally missing in an absolute sense, suggesting that market existence is less of a problem than market function.},

We assessed maize yield responses to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) application and evaluated relationships between crop responses to N, P and K application and soil analysis data. Nutrient omission trials were conducted on 23 farms located in Sidindi, Western Kenya, selected to be representative of the main soil and management factors in maize based systems in Siaya County. Treatments included a control and PK, NK, NP and NPK applications. The trials ran for six consecutive cropping seasons, without changing treatments or plot location, covering the period 2013–2015. Strong spatial-temporal patterns in maize yield responses to N, P and K applications were observed. Average maize yields in the control, PK, NK, NP and NPK treatments were 2.8, 3.2, 5.1, 5.1 and 5.5 t ha−1 at 88{\%} dry matter respectively in the first cropping season, and 1.1, 1.4, 2.9, 3.6 and 5.3 t ha−1 at 88{\%} dry matter respectively in the sixth cropping season. In all seasons, variability in maize yield between fields was greatest in the control treatment followed by the NK treatment and least in the NPK treatment. Mean relative yield was 0.6, 0.92 and 0.93 for N, P and K respectively, in the first cropping season, and 0.25, 0.52 and 0.68, respectively, in the sixth cropping season. Six main maize yield response categories were identified that differed in the maize grain yield responses to recursive N, P and K applications. Maize yield responses to N, P and K were not fully accounted for by soil organic matter, soil available P and exchangeable K respectively. Our results indicate that current methods for soil analysis do not adequately predict the response to application of N, P and K fertilizer under the highly variable soil fertility conditions encountered in smallholder farming systems. The strong spatial-temporal patterns observed present major challenges for the development of effective site-specific fertilizer recommendations.

abstract = {For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that agriculture is a major driver of climate change as well as being acutely challenged to adapt to its effects. Agroecological approaches involve the application of integrated ecological, economic and social principles to the transition of smallholder farming systems, towards greater resilience. This involves adapting 13 generic agroecological principles to local circumstances. The principles include: diversification, recycling, and better connecting producers and consumers. Adaptation is done by scientists working closely with farmers and other stakeholders to co-create concrete, demand-led solutions to pressing problems as they are experienced locally rather than through imposing externally prefabricated solutions that may not be locally appropriate. Agroecology comprises transdisciplinary science; sustainable agricultural practices; and, social movements that are precipitating widespread behaviour change. Agroecological principles map closely to principles of adaptation with the notable exception that while they often exhibit resilience benefits, these are incidental rather than representing an explicit response to climate signals. Current market failures (for example not costing pollution nor valuing the maintenance of soil organic carbon); and, perverse policy incentives (for example subsidizing use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides) combine to mitigate against decisions for farmers and other food system actors to adopt agroecological approaches despite their benefits for climate resilience. Agroecology manifests at field, farm and landscape scales, for which different metrics of agricultural performance are relevant in order for agroecological practices to be fairly judged against alternatives. Operationalising new and holistic performance metrics for agriculture will require innovation in both public and private (value chain) sector governance.},

Out of the 22 tested, two hybrids CKPH08035 (7.4-9.9 t ha-1) and CKPH08039 (7.3-9.8 t ha-1) significantly out yielded the commercial standards WH505 (8.8 t ha-1) and BH140 (5.5 t ha-1). In addition to yield, the improved hybrids also possess desirable traits including good plant height, good plant and ear aspects and good husk cover. The hybrid CKPH08004 had the lowest Dobie index of susceptibility and was regarded as resistant to S. zeamais. Weevils fed with the resistant hybrids produced low numbers of F1 generation weevils, had a high median developmental time and a low percentage of grain damage and grain weight loss. An increasing number of F1 generation resulted in an increasing grain damage and grain weight loss. We found an inverse relationship between the susceptibility index and percent mortality. However, the numbers of F1 generation, percent grain damage and grain weight loss were positively correlated with the susceptibility index. The use of resistant maize hybrids should be promoted in managing S. zeamais in stored maize under subsistence farming conditions in Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sustainable Intensification (SI) is essential for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to meet the food demand of the growing population under conditions of increasing land scarcity. However, access to artificial fertilizers is limited, and the current extension system is not effective in serving smallholder farmers. This paper studies farmers' response to improved fertilizer availability under field conditions. Data on farms and families were collected from 267 smallholder farms, while data on fertilizer use and crop response to fertilizer were collected on 127 farm plots. Fertilizer applications and maize yields were measured, and benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of fertilizer application was calculated and to assess its effect on food security. Farm household typologies were used to determine differences in farm endowment and food security classes. Fertilizer application did not significantly improve maize yields in 2017 due to unfavorable weather conditions and pest infestations, whereas significant yield responses were observed in 2018. Consequently, fertilizer application was economically beneficial (BCR {\textgreater}1) for only 45{\%} of the farmers in 2017, compared to 94{\%} in 2018 when 80{\%} of the farmers passed the technology adaptation point (BCR {\textgreater} 2). Surprisingly, economic returns did not vary significantly between household types, implying that fertilizer application provides comparable benefits across all farm types. This is partly explained by the fact that soil fertility varied little between farm types (soil carbon content, for example, showed no correlation with farmer endowment). Still, large differences were observed in farmers' willingness to invest in larger fertilizer applications. Only a small proportion of farmers is expected to increase fertilizer applications as recommended. Our work demonstrates the need to address risks for smallholders and shows that socio-economic aspects are more important than biophysical constraints for policies promoting sustainable intensification.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS). RAAIS is a diagnostic tool that can guide the analysis of complex agricultural problems and innovation capacity of the agricultural system in which the complex agricultural problem is embedded. RAAIS focuses on the integrated analysis of different dimensions of problems (e.g. biophysical, technological, socio-cultural, economic, institutional and political), interactions across different levels (e.g. national, regional, local), and the constraints and interests of different stakeholder groups (farmers, government, researchers, etc.). Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system. RAAIS combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide specific entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of RAAIS to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.},

The study compares different discourses on models of intensification that differ in the role nature plays in the actual design of the systems. While sustainable intensification is generally loosely defined, so that almost any model or technology can be labeled under it, ecological intensification proposes landscape approaches that make smart use of the natural functionalities that ecosystems offer. The aim is to design multifunctional agroecosystems that are both sustained by nature and sustainable in their nature. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Innovation in agronomy by large numbers of smallholder farmers will need to accelerate if global commitments to end hunger are to be achieved in the face of major climate and other global change that are both caused by, and impact, agriculture. Conventional research and development in agronomy have involved a research process that produces technologies, which are then promoted for uptake by large numbers of farmers through extension, with both research and extension phases being more or less participatory. Recent research, including key contributions to this special issue, reveals that the performance of many technology options varies hugely across the geographies over which development programmes operate, depending on social, economic and ecological context. This severely limits the value of attempting to produce recommendations for large areas and numbers of farmers and identifies the need for new ways of supporting innovation that address the real-world heterogeneity of farmer circumstances. Addressing this widespread phenomenon of option by context interaction (OxC) has profound implications for how agronomic research and development are organised. Papers in this special issue show the nature and implications of such interactions and suggest ways in which research and development systems need to respond in order to support locally relevant innovation. It is evident that a paradigm shift is well underway, with researchers embracing new modes of thinking and action required to address OxC interactions, but these also need to be taken up and further developed by extension and change agents in the public and private sector. It is only through continued co-development of methods involving both these constituencies, working closely with farmers that sufficient progress is likely to be made for smallholder farming to keep pace with global demand for food without further damaging the environmental resources upon which production is based.},

Tithonia (Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray) green manure, cypress sawdust (Cupressus lusitanica Mill.), and biochar made from eucalyptus wood (Eucalyptus saligna Sm.) were applied at a rate of 6 t C ha-1 for three cropping seasons, both with and without mineral fertilizer additions (120 kg N ha-1, 100 kg K ha-1, 100 kg P ha-1). Maize grain yield was monitored for six years beyond the initial organic matter additions. During the years when amendments were added, tithonia applications resulted in the greatest yield increases, between 153 and 183{\%} more than the unamended control in comparison to increases by136{\%} with biochar and by 107{\%} with sawdust additions. In contrast to application of tithonia, peak yields with sawdust or biochar in most cases occurred 1-2 years after additions had ended. Yet during the same period, yields in fields that had previously received tithonia were on average still 71{\%} of peak yields. Four years later, yields declined to between 28 and 22{\%} of peak yields, whereas yields after biochar and sawdust applications declined to between 57 and 25{\%} of peak values. Six years after organic matter additions ended, maize yields were not significantly different irrespective of additions of the quality of organic amendments. The data indicate that yield responds in the short-term to input quality and specifically the amount of applied N; while the residual effects of organic matter additions on yield dynamics may relate more to legacy effects of high crop residue return, input C quality and increasing soil C.},

abstract = {Scientists develop decision support systems (DSSs) to make agricultural science more accessible for farmers and extension officers. Despite the growing use of participatory approaches in agricultural DSS development, reflection on this endeavour has largely focused on the 'doing' of participation or the 'problem of implementation' when DSSs have not been adopted by stakeholders. There has been little reference to relevant theoretical approaches to the social processes involved in 'participation' or 'implementation'. However, if DSS use is to reach its full potential, a more conceptually informed understanding of how stakeholders collaborate in the participatory development of DSSs is required. To contribute to this conceptualisation, we developed a framework based on three concepts drawn from the field of science and technology studies: technological frames, interpretative flexibility and boundary objects. The framework highlights the importance and value of social learning for participatory DSS development, which relies upon exploring the participating parties' different perspectives on the agricultural system represented in the DSS. Our framework provides a broad definition of success for participatory DSS development, placing greater weight on learning during the participatory process compared with subsequent use of the DSS by farmers and/or advisors. Two case studies of stakeholder collaboration to develop an irrigation scheduling DSS for sugarcane production were used to explore the relevance of the framework. The concepts in the framework were clearly displayed during the case studies. At the conclusion of the studies there were contrasting outcomes for the DSS. One group of farmers was keen to apply it in their ongoing irrigation management, while another saw little relative advantage in use of the DSS. In both instances co-learning occurred amongst case study participants, so the participatory process was clearly a success. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The present study explores the methodology for assessment of the impact of 20 years of simulated water erosion on production of maize in Kenya. It uses databases on soils, climate and crops and several models are combined to arrive at a productivity impact calculation. Outcome of the modelling exercise may serve as a basis for prioritizing land-use policies, conservation measures and research at a national level. The methodology comprises four steps: (1) creating basic evaluation units, by climatic zonation of soil and terrain units, (2) suitability assessment for low input and rainfed maize cultivation, (3) definition of a water erosion scenario, by translating computed water erosion risk into four classes of depth of topsoil lost over 20 years' time, (4) calculation of crop yield potentials for the current situation and with inclusion of the erosion scenario, accounting for lost nutrients through topsoil erosion and for altered soil physical conditions. The study shows that a major part of Kenya is too dry for growing maize. Potentially suitable areas for growing maize in Kenya generally have a high yield potential, but considerable yield gaps exist. Furthermore, these areas are highly vulnerable to water erosion. In the very steep patches of land in the central and central-western part of Kenya, water-limit yield decline projected over 20 years is over 50 per cent. Nutrient-limited yield potentials are even more affected by the loss of topsoil.},

Transformation of agricultural systems, for example switching crop types or moving out of agriculture, is projected to be necessary in some cases. However, little attention has been paid to the timing of these transformations. Here, we develop a temporal uncertainty framework using the CMIP5 ensemble to assess when and where cultivation of key crops in sub-Saharan Africa becomes unviable. We report potential transformational changes for all major crops during the twenty-first century, as climates shift and areas become unsuitable. For most crops, however, transformation is limited to small pockets ({\textless}15{\%} of area), and only for beans, maize and banana is transformation more widespread ({\^{a}} 1/430{\%} area for maize and banana, 60{\%} for beans). We envisage three overlapping adaptation phases to enable projected transformational changes: an incremental adaptation phase focused on improvements to crops and management, a preparatory phase that establishes appropriate policies and enabling environments, and a transformational adaptation phase in which farmers substitute crops, explore alternative livelihoods strategies, or relocate. To best align policies with production triggers for no-regret actions, monitoring capacities to track farming systems as well as climate are needed.},

Among heavy metals, cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential and toxic metal, rapidly taken up by roots and accumulated in various plant tissues which hamper the crop growth and productivity worldwide. Plants employ various strategies to counteract the inhibitory effect of Cd, among which nutrient management is one of a possible way to overcome Cd toxicity. Sulfur (S) uptake and assimilation are crucial for determining crop yield and resistance to Cd stress. Cd affects S assimilation pathway which leads to the activation of pathway responsible for the synthesis of cysteine (Cys), a precursor of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. GSH, a nonprotein thiol acts as an important antioxidant in mitigating Cd-induced oxidative stress. it also plays an important role in phytochelatins (PCs) synthesis, which has a proven role in Cd detoxification. Therefore, S assimilation is considered a crucial step for plant survival under Cd stress. The aim of this review is to discuss the regulatory mechanism of S uptake and assimilation, GSH and PC synthesis for Cd stress tolerance in crop plants. {\textcopyright} 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is widely promoted as an approach for reorienting agricultural development under the realities of climate change. Prioritising research-for-development activities is crucial, given the need to utilise scarce resources as effectively as possible. However, no framework exists for assessing and comparing different CSA research investments. Several aspects make it challenging to prioritise CSA research, including its multi-dimensional nature (productivity, adaptation and mitigation), the uncertainty surrounding many climate impacts, and the scale and temporal dependencies that may affect the benefits and costs of CSA adoption. Here we propose a framework for prioritising agricultural research investments across scales and review different approaches to setting priorities among agricultural research projects. Many priority-setting case studies address the short- to medium-term and at relatively local scales. We suggest that a mix of actions that span spatial and temporal time scales is needed to be adaptive to a changing climate, address immediate problems and create enabling conditions for enduring change.},

abstract = {This study uses new data from a household survey (n= 179) in Mulanje District, Malawi to examine whether the observed adoption plateaus for modern maize varieties in Malawi partly reflect farmer interest in a diversity of maize seed attributes. Regression results for the study area indicate that specific attributes of different maize varieties are an important influence on their use. The benefits to growing hybrid maize appear to be yield and drought tolerance. Open pollinated varieties are selected by farmers who value early maturity. Local maize varieties are popular among farm households owing to a number of favourable processing and consumption characteristics: storability, poundability, flour-to-grain ratio, and taste. Further research using nationally representative data is needed to assess whether findings for Mulanje District can be generalized to Malawi as a whole. If future studies agree with the results herein then maize breeding research programs in Malawi should consider a diversity of traits beyond grain yield to encompass the range of production, processing, and consumption attributes that are valued by farmers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The processes of nutrient depletion and soil degradation that limit productivity of smallholder African farms are spatially heterogeneous. Causes of variability in soil fertility management at different scales of analysis are both biophysical and socio-economic. Such heterogeneity is categorised in this study, which quantifies its impact on nutrient flows and soil fertility status at region and farm scales, as a first step in identifying spatial and temporal niches for targeting of soil fertility management strategies and technologies. Transects for soil profile observation, participatory rural appraisal techniques and classical soil sampling and chemical analysis were sampled across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka), which together represent much of the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Five representative farm types were identified using socio-economic information and considering production activities, household objectives and the main constraints faced by farmers. Soil fertility management and nutrient resource flows were studied for each farm type and related to differences in soil fertility status at farm scale. Farm types 1 and 2 were the wealthiest; the former relied on off-farm income and farmed small pieces of land (0.6-1.1 ha) while the latter farmed relatively large land areas (1.6-3.8 ha) mainly with cash crops. The poorest farm type 5 also farmed small pieces of land (0.4-1.0 ha) but relied on low wages derived from working for wealthier farmers. Both farm types 1 and 5 relied on off-farm earnings and sold the least amounts of farm produce to the market, though the magnitude of their cash, labour and nutrient flows was contrasting. Farms of types 3 and 4 were intermediate in size and wealth, and represented different crop production strategies for self-consumption and the market. Average grain yields fluctuated around 1 t ha-1 year -1 for all farm types and sub-locations. Grain production by farms of types 4 and 5 was much below annual family requirements, estimated at 170 kg person-1 year-1. Household wealth and production orientation affected the pattern of resource flow at farm scale. In the land-constrained farms of type 1, mineral fertilisers were often used more intensively (ca. 50 kg ha-1), though with varying application rates (14-92 kg ha-1). The use of animal manure in such small farms (e.g. 2.2 t year-1) represented intensities of use of up to 8 t ha -1, and a net accumulation of C and macronutrients brought into the farm by livestock. In farms of type 5, intensities of use of mineral and organic fertilisers ranged between 0-12 kg ha-1 and 0-0.5 t ha-1, respectively. A consistent trend of decreasing input use from farm types 1-5 was generally observed, but nutrient resources and land management practices (e.g. fallow) differed enormously between sub-locations. Inputs of nutrients were almost nil in Aludeka farms. Both inherent soil properties and management explained the variability found in soil fertility status. Texture explained the variation observed in soil C and related total N between sub-locations, whereas P availability varied mainly between farm types as affected by input use. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An experiment was conducted at the research station of the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) at Machakos, Kenya from November 1989 to February 1996 to evaluate the effect of annual and perennial legumes on soil fertility, cereal yields and economic returns. The study evaluated six cropping systems: (1) continuous sole maize, (2) maize rotated with short-duration legume, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.), (3) maize rotated with long-duration legume, pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.), (4) maize intercropped with pigeonpea, (5) hedgerow intercropping of maize and a perennial legume, gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), and (6) continuous sole maize, green-manured with gliricidia prunings produced from an equivalent area outside the cropped field ('biomass transfer technology'). Maize-cowpea sequential and pigeonpea/maize intercropping systems produced, respectively, 17 and 24{\%} higher maize yields than continuous sole maize, but maize-pigeonpea rotation yielded only marginally better. Hedgerow intercropping did not increase maize yields because increased yields during the few high rainfall seasons did not compensate the yield losses in other seasons due to the competition of hedgerows for water with crop. Green manuring with gliricidia prunings increased maize production by 27{\%}, but this technology was not economical because of high labour costs for production and application of prunings to the crop. The annual grain legume-based cropping systems were 32-49{\%} more profitable than continuous sole maize, making them attractive to small farmers in semi-arid tropics. Both cowpea and pigeonpea were affected by pests and diseases, which indicated the need for integrated pest management for realising the potential benefits of these legume-based systems.

abstract = {Growing empirical evidence suggests that innovation platforms can be effective in enhancing agricultural research impact by creating an enabling environment for scaling of innovations such as novel technologies, practices and busines models . However, efforts to understand how these innovation platforms operate to scale innovations are insufficient. Such knowledge is critical for improving the design of agricultural innovation systems, specifically within the context of a rising interest in the innovation platform approach to support the transformation of agriculture across Africa. This paper investigates the scaling approaches employed by innovation platforms established in Rwanda. The study focused on four innovation platforms created as part of the Sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Program and analysed their activities and the resulting scaling outcomes. The findings show that two approaches can be effectively combined during the intervention; (1) the innovation process that resembles a traditional, linear approach of finding short-term solutions to specific problems (push approach) and (2) the network building process where platforms employed multi-level, transdisciplinary processes (pull approach). In two areas, the platform activities appeared to have contributed to increased revenues of farmers. The alignment of the innovation platform activities with political agendas or broadly, the extent to which the scaling strategy considers the existing conducive context is shown to play a critical role in the scaling process. The study shows that a balanced combination of both push and pull approaches and a strategic linkage between the platform activities and external development – government policies and interventions – are critical for a productive agricultural transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also indicate that the scaling processes require a “protected space” to materialise, and the scaling approach needs flexibility to accommodate the complexity of each innovation.},

abstract = {This document reviews the current state of knowledge on agroforestry parkland systems. These systems are generally understood as landscapes in which mature trees occur scattered in cultivated or recently fallowed fields, in which livestock production may be either a significant or secondary component; they are intermediate between savanna woodlands and grasslands in terms of vegetation types. Parkland systems are for many local populations very important for food security, income generation and environmental protection. They are found primarily in the semiarid and subhumid zones of West Africa, but similar systems exist in other such zones and in temperate regions. The document first provides definitions and a thorough description of their distribution and diversity and discusses different ways of classifying them. It also presents data on current trends in parkland development and assesses determining factors. An in-depth analysis is then provided of biophysical tree- soil-crop interactions and the factors regulating them, and various improved parkland management techniques are described. The strength and limitations are then examined of institutional arrangements and the constraints imposed by Sahelian forest policies on the sustainable management of parklands. The production, use and marketing of parkland products is reviewed with an emphasis on their contribution to food security, local and national income as well as social values. Overall costs and benefits of the practice of parkland agroforestry are evaluated. In conclusion, the document identifies crucial research needs and promising avenues for promoting sustainable management of parkland systems},

abstract = {Low inherent soil fertility in the highly weathered and leached soils largely accounts for low and unsustained crop yields in most African countries. But in particular, the major nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are commonly deficient in these soils. This scenario of nutrient depletion is reflected in food deficits and hence the food aid received continuously, specifically in sub-Saharan Africa. Undoubtedly, substantial efforts have been made in the continent to replenish the fertility of degraded soils in attempts to raise crop yields, towards self-sufficiency and export. Such efforts consist of applications of both organic and inorganic resources to improve the nutrient status of soils and enhanced nutrient uptake by crops, provided that soil moisture is adequate. Overall, positive crop responses to these materials have been obtained. Thus in the East African region, maize (staple) yields have been raised in one growing season from below 0.5 t/ha without nutrient inputs, to 3-5 t/ha from various nutrient amendments at the smallhold farm level. However, in spite of the positive crop responses to nutrient inputs, farmers are generally slow to adopt the soil fertility management technologies. In this paper we review the impact of some technologies, focussing the use of nutrient resources of different characteristics (qualities) in relation to improved crop yields, with an overall goal to enhance technology adoption. Thus, inorganic resources or fertilizers often give immediate crop responses, but their use or adoption is rather restricted to large-scale farmers who can afford to buy these materials. Organic resources, which include crop residues, water hyacinth and agroforestry shrubs and trees, are widely distributed, but they are generally of low quality, reflecting the need to apply large quantities to meet crop nutrient demands. Moreover, most organics will add N mainly to soils. On the other hand, phosphate rocks of varying reactivity are found widely in Africa and are refined elsewhere to supply soluble P sources. The recently developed soil fertility management options in East Africa have targeted the efficient use of N and P by crops and the integrated nutrient management approach. Some people have also felt that the repackaging of inputs in small, affordable quantities, such as the PREP-PAC described in this paper, may be an avenue to attract smallhold farmers to use nutrient inputs. Nonetheless, crop responses to nutrient inputs vary widely within and across agroecozones (AEZs), suggesting specificity in recommendations. We highlight this observation in a case study whereby eight soil fertility management options, developed independently, are being tested side-by-side at on-farm level. Farmers will be empowered to identify technologies from their own choices that are agronomically effective and economically friendly. This approach of technology testing and subsequent adoption is recommended for technology development in future. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer.},

abstract = {This paper examines the idea that plasticity in farm management introduces resilience to change and allows farm businesses to perform when operating in highly variable environments. We also argue for the need to develop and apply more integrative assessments of farm performance that combine the use of modelling tools with deliberative processes involving farmers and researchers in a co-learning process, to more effectively identify and implement more productive and resilient farm businesses.In a plastic farming system, farm management is highly contingent on environmental conditions. In plastic farming systems farm managers constantly vary crops and inputs based on the availability of limited and variable resources (e.g. land, water, finances, labour, machinery, etc.), and signals from its operating environment (e.g. climate, markets), with the objective of maximising a number of, often competing, objectives (e.g. maximise profits, minimise risks, etc.). In contrast in more rigid farming systems farm management is more calendar driven and relatively fixed sequences of crops are regularly followed over time and across the farm. Here we describe the application of a whole farm simulation model to (i) compare, in silico, the sensitivity of two farming systems designs of contrasting levels of plasticity, operating in two contrasting environments, when exposed to a stressor in the form of climate change scenarios;(ii) investigate the presence of interactions and feedbacks at the field and farm levels capable of modifying the intensity and direction of the responses to climate signals; and (iii) discuss the need for the development and application of more integrative assessments in the analysis of impacts and adaptation options to climate change.In both environments, the more plastic farm management strategy had higher median profits and was less risky for the baseline and less intensive climate change scenarios (2030). However, for the more severe climate change scenarios (2070), the benefit of plastic strategies tended to disappear. These results suggest that, to a point, farming systems having higher levels of plasticity would enable farmers to more effectively respond to climate shifts, thus ensuring the economic viability of the farm business. Though, as the intensity of the stress increases (e.g. 2070 climate change scenario) more significant changes in the farming system might be required to adapt. We also found that in the case studies analysed here, most of the impacts from the climate change scenarios on farm profit and economic risk originated from important reductions in cropping intensity and changes in crop mix rather than from changes in the yields of individual crops. Changes in cropping intensity and crop mix were explained by the combination of reductions in the number of sowing opportunities around critical times in the cropping calendar, and to operational constraints at the whole farm level i.e. limited work capacity in an environment having fewer and more concentrated sowing opportunities. This indicates that indirect impacts from shifts in climate on farm operations can be more important than direct impacts from climate on the yield of individual crops. The results suggest that due to the complexity of farm businesses, impact assessments and opportunities for adaptation to climate change might also need to be pursued at higher integration levels than the crop or the field. We conclude that plasticity can be a desirable characteristic in farming systems operating in highly variable environments, and that integrated whole farm systems analyses of impacts and adaptation to climate change are required to identify important interactions between farm management decision rules, availability of resources, and farmer's preference. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

However, their full potential is not being realized. The purpose of this study was to assess farmers' perceptions and knowledge towards legumes and the rationale of farmers for current legume production practices using a survey of 268 farmers in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya. Most of the farmers had some knowledge of legumes and their characteristics. However, they had little knowledge of some key functions, including soil erosion control and soil fertility improvement. Most farmers relied on radio and other farmers for legume-related information. Farmers with relatively large livestock holdings ranked provision of livestock feed as an important legume function. We conclude that farmers put more value on short-term benefits of legumes including food and income than long-term benefits such as natural resource management and thus grain legumes are more readily identified by farmers than forage species. Also, we conclude that farmers require more than just information about legumes to increase uptake, they also require improved market access to procure inputs and sell products to realize other benefits that are associated with growing legumes.},

Initially, several Sentinel-2 variables including nine single spectral bands and 12 spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were used in combination with forest management variables to predict tree volume/ha and height using Random Forest. The results showed a 10-12 {\%} increase in out of bag (OOB) r2 when Sentinel-2 variables were included in the prediction of both volume and height together with BGI. Later, selected Sentinel-2 variables were used for biomass growth prediction in Maine, USA and New Brunswick, Canada using data from 7738 provincial permanent sample plots. The Sentinel-2 red-edge position (S2REP) index was identified as the most important variable over others to have known influence on site productivity. While a slight improvement in the iBGI accuracy occurred compared to the base BGI model ({\~{}}2{\%}), substantial changes to coefficients of other variables were evident and some site variables became less important when S2REP was included.},

Appropriate stand density may enhance species ability to adapt to CC. Therefore, combining species distribution modeling (SDM) and spatial pattern of density should provide insightful information for setting conservation actions. We combined geostatistical and SDM techniques to assess (1) current tree density spatial pattern and its relationship with bioclimatic zone (humid, sub-humid, and semi-arid), land-use type (protected areas vs. agrosystems), and soil type (eight types), and (2) present-day and future distributions of suitable habitats under low-RCP4.5 and high-RCP8.5 emissions scenarios for Borassus aethiopum, a declining agroforestry palm in Benin. Data were obtained from 2880 one-ha plots. Semivariogram and kriging were used to model spatial patterns of density while Maximum Entropy was used for SDM. Tree density followed an isotropic spatial model with a range of 2.15 km, indicating extremely fragmented density pattern. Tree density was 8-times higher in protected areas (PAs, 68.6 ± 5.09 trees ha−1) than in agrosystems (8.4 ± 0.31 trees ha−1) and greater on ferruginous soils. Though 80{\%} of the country was currently highly suitable with similar trend for PAs and agrosystems, future predictions showed major habitat loss (20–61{\%}), particularly under RCP8.5. While changes were similar between PAs and agrosystems, the decrease in habitat suitability was pronounced in the semi-arid zone where the species is currently widely-distributed with higher abundance. Very weak link was found between present-day abundance and present-day and future distribution. It is concluded that B. aethiopum has a fragmented density pattern and will be sensitive to CC. In-situ and circa-situ conservations or orchards establishment were suggested depending on the projected changes and the bioclimatic zone. The approach used here is exemplary for other agroforestry tree species.},

abstract = {The soil science community is facing a growing demand of regional, continental, and worldwide databases in order to monitor the status of the soil. However, the availabilityof such data is very scarce. Cost-effective tools to measure soil properties for large areas (e.g., Europe) are required. Soil spectroscopy has shown to be a fast, cost-effective, environmental- friendly, nondestructive, reproducible, and repeatable analytical technique. The main aim of this paper is to describe the state of the art of soil spectroscopy as well as its potential to facilitating soil monitoring. The factors constraining the application of soil spectroscopy as an alternative to traditional laboratory analyses, together with the limits of the technique, are addressed. The paper also highlights that the widespread use of spectroscopy to monitor the status of the soil should be encouraged by (1) the creation of a standard for the collection of laboratory soil spectra, to promote the sharing of spectral libraries, and (2) the scanning of existing soil archives, reducing the need for costly sampling campaigns. Finally, routine soil analysis using soil spectroscopy would be beneficial for the end users by a reduction in analytical costs, and an increased comparability of results between laboratories. This ambitious project will materialize only through (1) the establishment of local and regional partnerships among existent institutions able to generate the necessary technical competence, and (2) the support of international organizations. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of United Nations and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission are well placed to promote the use of laboratory and field spectrometers formonitoring the state of soils. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The promulgation of Kenya's Constitution in 2010 portended a plethora of reforms key amongst them being; devolution of various sectors including agriculture. The devolved framework for agriculture is anchored in Part 2 of the Fourth Schedule, providing that the national government shall have exclusive responsibility of agricultural policy formulation whilst the county government shall facilitate, implement and oversee all other agricultural related matters including the implementation of national policies on agriculture. A key constitutional requirement is that both levels of government must observe and be guided by the principles of distinctiveness and interdependence encapsulated in Article 6 (2). Collectively, these principles echo the indicators of devolved governance which include the fact that even though both governments are autonomous institutions, they are interrelated and need to work together; especially when discharging their devolved functions including agriculture. In doing so, it is envisaged that both governments must discharge their functions on the basis of cooperation and consultation. Strikingly, Kenya's Constitution largely lacks specific provisions to reinforce a robust regime for the implementation of devolved agriculture. Accordingly, the National Government enacted two key pieces of legislations namely; the Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Authority Act, 2013 and the Crops Act, 2013, as the blueprint for devolved agriculture. A cursory glance of the two pieces of legislation however reveal legislative impediments to the implementation of devolved agriculture. This paper therefore seeks to demystify the quest for devolved governance of agriculture in Kenya by generating indicators of devolved governance and thereon examining the extent to which they have been incorporated in the context of agriculture in Kenya.},

abstract = {In the face of unsustainable land-use changes including intensified agricultural production and land abandonment, agroforestry systems have the potential to support a diversity of social and ecological functions in agricultural landscapes. Mediterranean agroforestry landscapes have been conserved through traditional practices, and new concepts are necessary to assure the viability of these practices. Labels bear the opportunity to indicate sustainable management along the supply chain and, at the same time, generate higher incomes for sustainably producing farms. We have used an expert-based Delphi survey with three iterative surveys to analyse (1) the relevance of different sustainability aspects in agroforestry systems, (2) the suitability of derived indicators for labelling, and (3) the specific potentials and barriers for labelling agroforestry production or ecological UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)—are considered relevant for agroforestry systems. Translating these goals into suitable indicators is the more challenging step, revealing the lack of appropriate data, the complexity of sustainability challenges, and a low willingness for producers to adapt their practices as key limiting factors. The assessment of the labelling schemes indicated coherent responses despite the diverse backgrounds of participants. Alongside eco-labels and social labels, Geographic Indications were suggested as the most suitable options for the agroforestry context, although these have not been invented for reflecting sustainability in the first place. Although experts are highly aware of social-cultural values of agroforestry systems, they see little potential to use those social-cultural aspects for labelling agroforestry products. Initial costs and missing consumer awareness for agroforestry are major reasons for not joining labelling schemes. We discuss the possibility of an agroforestry label and why elements of Geographic Indication labels may fit well for this purpose.},

New frontiers can be opened up by breaking out of, and reversing many of the ideas, values, methods and behaviour normally dominant in disciplines and departments, by offsetting biases, decentralizing, encouraging diversity, and attempting to put people before things. These themes are explored through analysis of different topics: normal professionalism and new paradigms; modes of thought and procedures; poverty-focused projects and the project process; tropical seasonality; agricultural research and extension; NGOs' comparative competence with new participatory approaches and methods; and an ideology of reversals and practical pluralism, to dismantle the disabling state and empower the poor.},

abstract = {Despite significant efforts in agriculture market development, millions of smallholder farmers remain isolated from markets, due to remoteness and low farm productivity. Push/ pull approaches to market development suggest a dual strategy for bringing smallholders into agricultural markets: 1) reduce producer vulnerability and build capacities, based on market requirements; and 2) facilitate relationships for producers to deal in consistent, growing markets. While simple in concept and effective as an approach, the execution of push/pull is complex. In particular, it is difficult to connect push (producer capacity) and pull (market) elements, resulting in unsustainable market linkages. When applying a push/ pull approach in areas where the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) works, AKF has noted that local entrepreneurs can link push and pull effectively and for the long term. This case study reviews how entrepreneurs link push and pull in AKF's market development programme in southern Tanzania. It outlines learning on how local entrepreneurs bridge gaps between producers and firms, taking the case of remote farmers accessing inputs (seed, fertilizer, implements, and pesticide) from larger suppliers. The paper describes the challenge of linking push and pull, outlines AKF's experience in southern Tanzania, and follows with points for discussion on incorporating local entrepreneurs into push/pull programmes.},

abstract = {Grain legumes play a key role in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in relation to food and nutrition security and income generation. Moreover, because of their N2-fixation capacity, such legumes can also have a positive influence on soil fertility. Notwithstanding many decades of research on the agronomy of grain legumes, their N2-fixation capacity, and their contribution to overall system productivity, several issues remain to be resolved to realize fully the benefits of grain legumes. In this paper we highlight major lessons learnt and expose key knowledge gaps in relation to grain legumes and their contributions to farming system productivity. The symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia forms the basis for its benefits and biological N2-fixation (BNF) relies as much on the legume genotype as on the rhizobial strains. As such, breeding grain legumes for BNF deserves considerably more attention. Even promiscuous varieties usually respond to inoculation, and as African soils contain a huge pool of unexploited biodiversity with potential to contribute elite rhizobial strains, strain selection should go hand-in-hand with legume breeding for N2-fixation. Although inoculated strains can outcompete indigenous strains, our understanding of what constitutes a good competitor is rudimentary, as well as which factors affect the persistence of inoculated rhizobia, which in its turn determines whether a farmer needs to re-inoculate each and every season. Although it is commonly assumed that indigenous rhizobia are better adapted to local conditions than elite strains used in inoculants, there is little evidence that this is the case. The problems of delivering inoculants to smallholders through poorly-developed supply chains in Africa necessitates inoculants based on sterile carriers with long shelf life. Other factors critical for a well-functioning symbiosis are also central to the overall productivity of grain legumes. Good agronomic practices, including the use of phosphorus (P)-containing fertilizer, improve legume yields though responses to inputs are usually very variable. In some situations, a considerable proportion of soils show no response of legumes to applied inputs, often referred to as non-responsive soils. Understanding the causes underlying this phenomenon is limited and hinders the uptake of legume agronomy practices. Grain legumes also contribute to the productivity of farming systems, although such effects are commonly greater in rotational than in intercropping systems. While most cropping systems allow for the integration of legumes, intercropped legumes provide only marginal benefits to associated crops. Important rotational benefits have been shown for most grain legumes though those with the highest N accumulation and lowest N harvest index appear to demonstrate higher residual benefits. N balance estimates often results in contradictory observations, mostly caused by the lack of understanding of belowground contributions of legumes to the N balance. Lastly, the ultimate condition for increased uptake of grain legumes by smallholder farmers lies in the understanding of how legume technologies and management practices can be tailored to the enormous diversity of agroecologies, farming systems, and smallholder farms in SSA. In conclusion, while research on grain legumes has revealed a number of important insights that will guide realization of the full potential of such legumes to the sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in SSA, many research challenges remain to be addressed to realize the full potential of BNF in these systems.},

Geertz and other researchers have suggested that intensification is likely to lead to crop specialization and a loss of diversity. Others, especially for Africa, have argued that intensification maintains or even increases agro-diversity. The case of Hamisi, in western Kenya, one of the most densely populated areas in all of rural Africa, supports the latter scenario. Farmers engage in a wide variety of sophisticated practices that maintain exceptionally high levels of agro-diversity. Their farming system includes complex patterns of intercropping, polyvariety, an emphasis on multi-purpose crops, and the close integration of crops and livestock. Despite this agro-diversity, we find that the intense population pressure in Hamisi has resulted in such small landholdings that diet quality and food security are seriously jeopardized. Despite the diversity of their farms, most families are highly dependent on market purchases and they consume very limited quantities of nutritionally dense foods, especially protein.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the nexus between the digital divide and development and discusses attempts being made at continental, regional and country levels to bridge the digital divide in sub-Saharan Africa. Design/methodology/approach - An analytical and comparative approach of global e-readiness, digital opportunity, and information society indices is applied to infer the status of the digital divide in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings - The paper finds that there is a link between bridging the digital divide and economic development. However, there is as yet no unanimity as to whether the digital divide is narrowing or widening in developing countries including those in sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, countries in sub-Saharan Africa are making tremendous strides, especially in infrastructure development and mobile phone connectivity, to bridge the digital divide. Research limitations/implications - An empirical study is needed to determine the impact of the surge in infrastructure and policy development in sub-Saharan Africa with regard to bridging the digital divide. Practical implications - Hitherto, attempts to measure the extent of the digital divide between and within countries have largely relied on e-readiness rankings and have rarely used other relevant indices that are available, such as e-government, information society, and digital opportunity indices. The use of a wide range of indices to infer the breadth and depth of the digital divide between sub-Saharan Africa and the developed world would provide a clearer picture of the extent of the divide. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates that several tools other than e-readiness ranking can be used to measure the breadth and depth of the digital divide. The paper brings to the fore the importance of addressing sub-Saharan Africa's digital divide peculiarities using extraordinary interventions.},

abstract = {Agriculture is in crisis. Soil health is collapsing. Biodiversity faces the sixth mass extinction. Crop yields are plateauing. Against this crisis narrative swells a clarion call for Regenerative Agriculture. But what is Regenerative Agriculture, and why is it gaining such prominence? Which problems does it solve, and how? Here we address these questions from an agronomic perspective. The term Regenerative Agriculture has actually been in use for some time, but there has been a resurgence of interest over the past 5 years. It is supported from what are often considered opposite poles of the debate on agriculture and food. Regenerative Agriculture has been promoted strongly by civil society and NGOs as well as by many of the major multi-national food companies. Many practices promoted as regenerative, including crop residue retention, cover cropping and reduced tillage are central to the canon of ‘good agricultural practices', while others are contested and at best niche (e.g. permaculture, holistic grazing). Worryingly, these practices are generally promoted with little regard to context. Practices most often encouraged (such as no tillage, no pesticides or no external nutrient inputs) are unlikely to lead to the benefits claimed in all places. We argue that the resurgence of interest in Regenerative Agriculture represents a re-framing of what have been considered to be two contrasting approaches to agricultural futures, namely agroecology and sustainable intensification, under the same banner. This is more likely to confuse than to clarify the public debate. More importantly, it draws attention away from more fundamental challenges. We conclude by providing guidance for research agronomists who want to engage with Regenerative Agriculture.},

It shows that small farms (less than 2 ha) operate about 12{\%} and family farms about 75{\%} of the world's agricultural land. It shows that average farm size decreased in most low- and lower-middle-income countries for which data are available from 1960 to 2000, whereas average farm sizes increased from 1960 to 2000 in some upper-middle-income countries and in nearly all high-income countries for which we have information. Such estimates help inform agricultural development strategies, although the estimates are limited by the data available.

abstract = {Heterogeneity in soil fertility in these smallholder systems is caused by both inherent soil-landscape and human-induced variability across farms differing in resources and practices. Interventions to address the problem of poor soil fertility in Africa must be designed to target such diversity and spatially heterogeneity. Data on soil management and soil fertility from six districts in Kenya and Uganda were gathered to understand the determinants of soil heterogeneity within farms. Analysis of the variance of soil fertility indicators across 250 randomly selected farms (i.e., 2607 fields), using a mixed model that considered site, sampling frame, farm type, and field as random terms, revealed that the variation in soil organic C (6.5-27.7 g kg -1), total N (0.6-3.0 g kg-1), and available P (0.9-27 mg kg-1) was mostly related to differences in the inherent properties of the soils across sites (50 to 60{\%} of total variance). Exchangeable K + (0.1-1.1 cmol(+) kg-1), Ca2+ (1.5-14.5 cmol(+) kg-1), Mg2+ (0.6-3.7 cmol(+) kg-1), and pH (5.1-6.9) exhibited larger residual variability associated with field-to-field differences within farms (30 to 50{\%}). Soil fertility indicators decreased significantly with increasing distance from the homesteads. When this variable was included in the model, the unexplained residual variances-associated with soil heterogeneity within farms-were 38{\%} for soil C; 32{\%} for total N; 49{\%} for available P; 56, 49, and 38{\%} for exchangeable K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively; and 49{\%} for the pH. In allocating nutrient resources, farmers prioritized fields they perceived as most fertile, reinforcing soil heterogeneity. Categorization of fields within a farm with respect to distance from the homestead, and soil fertility classes as perceived by farmers, were identified as entry points to target soil fertility recommendations to easily recognizable, distinct entities.

abstract = {Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information.

abstract = {Agricultural advisory systems aim to improve livelihoods and well-being of the rural community by enhancing information exchange and capacity for collective action. In East Africa, advisory systems are becoming more demand driven and are being provided by an increasingly complex range of actors using participatory approaches. Social network analysis (SNA) provides a tool to examine farmer networks for broad assessment of agricultural advisory systems. This paper proposes a framework linking social network measures to information flow and capacity for collective action and applies it to personal (egocentric) networks in 11 sites within East Africa. The results provide valuable insight into performance of existing advisory systems and areas for improvement. Limited capacity for collective action, based on information networks, anecdotal evidence and literature, within farmer groups and communities was found in the Rwanda and to some degree in the Kenyan sites. In Tanzania, few connections with external information sources were found, potentially limiting new innovations entering the communities. In applying the framework, consideration of external factors that can influence social network structures is required so that attribution is not overstated. Use of egocentric networks and recall error challenges exist but can be managed. The proposed SNA framework provides a new and useful assessment tool, particularly combined with broader frameworks, for government agriculture ministries, development practitioners and researchers to support the design and assessment of agricultural advisory systems.},

abstract = {Manure has been used as a fertilizer since ancient times and if well-managed it can be an asset, promoting sustainable agriculture, and increasing crop production, particularly for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, most farmers in SSA do not apply recommended manure management practices, such as roofing animal housing, having a water-proof floor or covering manure during storage, causing large nutrient losses during manure storage, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing the quality of the manure as a fertilizer. This paper compares manure management practices in representative SSA countries, and summarizes government policies and socio-cultural practices that influence the adoption of good (recommended) manure management practices. Three steps were applied in this analysis: (i) review of manure management practices from various literature sources, (ii) interviews on manure management practices and policies with key stakeholders from 13 SSA countries, and (iii) surveys of manure management practices on small, medium, and large scale farms in Ethiopia and Malawi. The review confirms the potential of manure to improve crop yields and promote sustainable agriculture in SSA. Unfortunately, most SSA countries (a) do not explicitly mention manure management in their policies (b) have different ministries that share responsibilities on manure management, often leading to incoherent policies and abnegation of these responsibilities (c) take limited action to promote good practices or enforce legislation on manure management. Also, the field survey indicated that farmers lack knowledge on manure management. However, farmers are able to access agricultural extension services from both government and non-government agencies, although these extension services rarely included information on improved manure management practices. Extension services that encourage exchange and interaction between farmers were most successful in increasing adoption of good manure management practices, and are recommended. In addition, efforts to improve manure management in SSA should strengthen the enforcement of existing policies and provide an enabling environment for adoption of good manure management practices.},

abstract = {Purpose: The objective of the study was to determine the level and determinants of demand for extension services among small-scale maize farmers in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an exploratory research design, primary data were collected from a sample of 352 households through face-to-face interviews. Focus group discussions were used to collect contextual data. The sample comprised of organic and conventional small-scale maize farmers in Bungoma County, Kenya. In data analyses, descriptive statistics and a zero inflated negative binomial regression were employed. Findings: Results indicate that organic farmers had a mean of three contacts with extension providers compared to conventional farmers who had a mean of one contact during the year. Further, age of the household head, education level, farming experience, amount of off-farm income and credit received, group membership, land tenure and distance to the nearest extension service provider significantly influence the demand for extension services. Practical implications: The major policy implication from the findings is that; whether farmers are organic or conventional, extension agents should customize their services according to their clients' socio-economic characteristics in order to improve demand for agricultural extension services. Originality/value: The study contributes to knowledge by applying the count data models in modeling the determinants of demand for extension services at a micro-level.},

However, adoption simplifies and mischaracterises what happens during processes of technological change. In all but the very simplest cases, it is likely to be inadequate to capture the complex reconfiguration of social and technical components of a technological practice or system. We review the insights of a large and expanding literature, from various disciplines, which has deepened understanding of technological change as an intricate and complex sociotechnical reconfiguration, situated in time and space. We explain the problems arising from the inappropriate use of adoption as a framing concept and propose an alternative conceptual framework for understanding and evaluating technological change. The new approach breaks down technology change programmes into four aspects: propositions, encounters, dispositions and responses. We begin to sketch out how this new framework could be operationalised.},

Here, we propose a generic and simple equilibrium model to estimate minimum input requirements of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for target yields in cereal crops under highly efficient management. The model was combined with Global Yield Gap Atlas data to explore minimum input requirements for self-sufficiency in 2050 for maize in nine countries in SSA. We estimate that yields have to increase from the current ca. 20{\%} of water-limited yield potential to approximately 50–75{\%} of the potential depending on the scenario investigated. Minimum nutrient input requirements must rise disproportionately more, with N input increasing 9-fold or 15-fold, because current production largely relies on soil nutrient mining, which cannot be sustained into the future.},

Several machine learning approaches were used in this study to investigate the relative influences of multiple biophysical, socio-economic, and crop management features in determining maize yield variability using several machine learning approaches. Soil fertility status was assessed in 180 farms and paired with the surveyed data on maize yield, socio-economic conditions, and agronomic management. The C{\&}RT relative variable importance plot identified farm size, total labor, soil factors, seed rate, fertilizer, and organic manure as influential factors. Among the three approaches compared for classifying maize yield, the artificial neural network (ANN) yielded the least (25{\%}) misclassification on validation samples. The random forest partial dependence plots revealed a positive association between farm size and maize productivity. Nonlinear support vector machine boundary analysis for the eight top important variables revealed complex interactions underpinning maize yield response. Notably, farm size and total labor synergistically increased maize yield. Future research integrating these algorithms with empirical crop growth models and crop simulation models for ex-ante yield estimations could result in further improvement.},

abstract = {Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J E Smith), an economically important pest native to tropical and sub-tropical America has recently invaded Africa, causing substantial damage to maize and other crops. We evaluated functionality of a companion cropping system, ‘climate-adapted push-pull', developed for control of cereal stemborers in drier agro-ecologies, as an added tool for the management of fall armyworm. The technology comprises intercropping maize with drought-tolerant greenleaf desmodium, Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb., and planting Brachiaria cv Mulato II as a border crop around this intercrop. Protection to maize is provided by semiochemicals that are emitted by the intercrop that repel (push) stemborer moths while those released by the border crop attract (pull) them. 250 farmers who had adopted the technology in drier areas of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were randomly selected for the study during the long rainy season (March-August) of 2017. Each farmer had a set of two plots, a climate-adapted push–pull and a maize monocrop. Data were collected in each plot on the number of fall armyworm larvae on maize, percentage of maize plants damaged by the larvae and maize grain yields. Similarly, farmers' perceptions of the impact of the technology on the pest were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Reductions of 82.7{\%} in average number of larvae per plant and 86.7{\%} in plant damage per plot were observed in climate-adapted push-pull compared to maize monocrop plots. Similarly, maize grain yields were significantly higher, 2.7 times, in the climate-adapted push-pull plots. Farmers rated the technology significantly superior in reducing fall armyworm infestation and plant damage rates. These results demonstrate that the technology is effective in controlling fall armyworm with concomitant maize grain yield increases, and represent the first documentation of a technology that can be immediately deployed for management of the pest in East Africa and beyond.},

Using this method, we can recognize maize plants as objects and calculate the distance between plants. We initially developed our method by training an algorithm in an indoor facility with plastic corn plants. Then, the method was scaled up and tested in a farmer's field with maize plant spacing that exhibited natural variation. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to precisely quantify the distance between maize plants. We found that accuracy of the measurement of the distance between maize plants depended on the height above ground level at which UAV imagery was taken. This study provides an innovative approach to quantify plant-to-plant variability and, thereby final crop yield estimates.},

abstract = {The shortfalls in the quality, quantity, and reliability of agriculture performance data are neither new nor confined to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is, however, a more dire challenge given the overwhelming importance of agriculture in the economies of most countries in the region in terms of food security and poverty reduction. While farmers' self-reported (SR) data on crop outputs and farm sizes remain popular variables for computing plot productivity and yields, especially in SSA, other methods such GPS measurement and remote sensing measurement of crop area, crop cuts (CC) as well as whole plot harvests have been touted as the gold standard methods for yield measurement. All these approaches to yield estimation are insufficient in capturing real agriculture productivity in rainfed farming systems due to the significant area loss that characterizes these farming systems in the course of each cropping season. This paper compares yield data of smallholder maize plots from two farming communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana based on farmer self-reported outputs and crop cuts, as well as GPS and aerial imagery measurement of plot area. The study finds a high level of agreement between GPS-measured plot area and that measured using remote sensing methods (R2 = 0.80) with the minor deviations between the two measures attributable to changes in farmers' plans in the course of the season with regards to their cultivation extent. More interestingly, the study finds a substantial disparity between measured CC yields and SR yields; 2174 kg/ha for CC yields compared to 651 kg/ha for SR yields. The significant disparity between the two measures of yield is partly attributable to the significant intra-plot variability in crop performance leading to plot area loss in the course of the season. This area loss (ranging from 15 to 30{\%} of the planted area) is usually not taken into account in current yield measurement approaches. Delineating the productive and planted-but-unproductive sections of plots has important implications not only for yield estimation methodologies but also for shedding more light on the factors underlying current poor yields and pathways to improving productivity on smallholder rainfed maize farms.},

abstract = {Bringing together emerging lessons from biophysical and social sciences as well as newly available data, we take stock of what can be learned about the relationship among subjective (reported) and objective (measured) soil fertility and farmer input use in east Africa. We identify the correlates of Kenyan and Tanzanian maize farmers' reported perceptions of soil fertility and assess the extent to which these subjective assessments reflect measured soil chemistry. Our results offer evidence that farmers base their perceptions of soil quality and soil type on crop yields. We also find that, in Kenya, farmers' reported soil type is a reasonable predictor of several objective soil fertility indicators while farmer-reported soil quality is not. In addition, in exploring the extent to which publicly available soil data are adequate to capture local soil chemistry realities, we find that the time-consuming exercise of collecting detailed objective measures of soil content is justified when biophysical analysis is warranted, because farmers' perceptions are not sufficiently strong proxies of these measures to be a reliable substitute and because currently available high-resolution geo-spatial data do not sufficiently capture local variation. In the estimation of agricultural production or profit functions, where the focus is on averages and in areas with low variability in soil properties, the addition of soil information does not considerably change the estimation results. However, having objective (measured) plot-level soil information improves the overall fit of the model and the estimation of marginal physical products of inputs. Our findings are of interest to researchers who design, field, or use data from agricultural surveys, as well as policy makers who design and implement agricultural interventions and policies.},

The rising temperatures and increased rainfall variability associated with climate change are undermining the livelihoods and food security of Africa's farmers, most of whom work at a subsistence level and also face problems of poverty, inadequate infrastructure and poor governance. To address these problems, governments and development organizations have promoted climate-smart agriculture (CSA). These projects, however, have been constrained by inadequate data and predictions regarding future climate change. In particular, farmers in Africa need better projections of the climate hazards for specific regions. Historical weather data at the local level contains many gaps, and the continuing collection of such data could be much improved. Strengthening the database of observed weather is critical to understanding the changes that have occurred already, to project future changes, and to plan appropriately to address them. Once collected and analyzed, climate data must be communicated in ways that help decision-makers understand climate impacts. Good tools are available---such as ClimateWizard.org and Servir ClimateServ---but practitioners at the local level must have the access and training to use them. Even in places where projections are uncertain, steps can be taken now to implement CSA practices and make farmers more resilient in the face of climate change.},

This paper extends the TAM model by adding two new constructs, perceived advantage and socio-economic characteristics. Consequently, the extended TAM was applied to adoption of mobile phones in farming communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study relies on a sample from 300 dairy farmers in Uganda which was analysed using structural equation modelling.

abstract = {Legume technologies are widely promoted among smallholders in southern Africa, providing an opportunity for sustainable intensification. Farms and farming strategies of smallholders differ greatly within any given locality and determine the opportunities for uptake of technologies. We provide an ex-ante assessment of the impact of grain legumes on different types of farms and identify niches for grain legumes in Malawi. After creation of a farm typology, detailed farm characterisations were used to describe the farming system. The characterisations provided the basis for the construction of simplified, virtual farms on which possible scenarios for expanding and intensifying grain legume production were explored using the farm-scale simulation model NUANCES-FARMSIM. Observed yields and labour inputs suggested that maize provides more edible yield per unit area with a higher calorific value and greater labour use efficiency than groundnut and soybean. Crop yields simulated by the model partly confirmed these yield trends, but at farm level maize-dominated systems often produced less food than systems with more grain legumes. Improved management practices such as addition of P-based fertiliser to grain legumes and inoculation of soybean were crucial to increase biological nitrogen fixation and grain yields of legumes and maize, and created systems with increased area of legumes that were more productive than the current farms. Improved legume management was especially a necessity for low resource endowed farmers who, due to little past use of P-based fertiliser and organic inputs, have soils with a poorer P status than wealthier farmers. Economic analyses suggested that legume cultivation was considerably more profitable than continuous maize cropping. Highest potential net benefits were achieved with tobacco, but the required financial investment made tobacco cultivation riskier. Grain legumes have excellent potential as food and cash crops particularly for medium and high resource endowed farmers, a role that could grow in importance as legume markets further develop. For low resource endowed farmers, legumes can improve food self-sufficiency of households, but only if legumes can be managed with P fertiliser and inoculation in the case of soybean. Given that low resource endowed farmers tend to be risk averse and have few resources to invest, the ability of poorer farmers to adopt legume technologies could be limited. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Parasitic weeds such as Striga spp and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa in smallholder rice production systems form an increasing problem for food and income security in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper we implement the Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS) as a diagnostic tool to identify specific and generic entry points for innovations to address parasitic weeds in rain-fed rice production in Tanzania. Data were gathered across three study sites in Tanzania where parasitic weeds are eminent (Kyela, Songea Rural and Morogoro Rural districts). The results demonstrate that in Tanzania, weeds in general and parasitic weeds in particular receive little attention in agricultural research, training and education curricula. Crop protection policies mainly focus on the control of (insect) pest and diseases and there is relatively little attention for weed prevention, which is essential for addressing parasitic weed problems effectively. Specific entry points for innovation include increasing awareness of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers and policymakers. In regions where awareness is relatively high, participatory research approaches can provide a basis for developing locally adapted parasitic weed management strategies. Generic entry points for innovation include enhanced collaboration and interaction between stakeholders across different levels, for example in multi-stakeholder platforms. This can provide the basis for developing and implementing coherent policy and development strategies to address structural constraints in the agricultural system, including the promotion of clean local seed systems, investments in physical and knowledge infrastructure development, adequate backstopping of agricultural extension officers, agribusiness training for farmers, quality control of agricultural inputs, timely access to agricultural inputs, and improved access to markets for farmers. Together the specific and generic entry points can strengthen the innovation capacity of Tanzania's agricultural system to address parasitic weed problems, as well as other complex agricultural problems.},

abstract = {Yield gaps are pervasive in African smallholder agriculture, and are large for almost all crops in all regions. There is consensus that poor soil fertility and nutrient availability are the major biophysical limitations to agricultural production in the continent. We identify two major yield gaps: (1) the gap between actual yields (YA) and the water-limited yield potential (Yw), which is the maximum yield achievable under rainfed conditions without irrigation if soil water capture and storage is optimal and nutrient constraints are released, and (2) The gap between YA, and a locally attainable yield (YL) which corresponds to the water and nutrient-limited yields that can be measured in the most productive fields of resource endowed farmers in a community. Estimates of these two yield gaps are given for major crops, together with a framework for how yield gaps can be estimated in a pragmatic way for different farming systems. The paradigm of ecological intensification which focuses on yield potential, soil quality and precision agriculture is explored for the African context. Our analysis suggests that smallholder farmers are unable to benefit from the current yield gains offered by plant genetic improvement. In particular, continued cropping without sufficient inputs of nutrients and organic matter leads to localised but extensive soil degradation and renders many soils in a non-responsive state. The lack of immediate response to increased inputs of fertiliser and labour in such soils constitutes a chronic poverty trap for many smallholder farmers in Africa. This necessitates a rethink for development policy aimed to improve productivity and address problems of food insecurity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Termite-induced injuries to maize and baby corn were evaluated in on-going comparison experiments on organic and conventional farming systems at two trial sites in the Central Highlands of Kenya (Chuka and Thika). The farming systems were established in 2007 at two input levels: Low input level, representing subsistence farming (Conv-Low, Org-Low) and high input level, representing commercial farming (Conv-High, Org-High). Termite-induced injuries to maize and baby corn, such as tunneling the stem or lodging the whole plant were assessed over two cropping seasons. The lodging occurred exclusively at Thika. It first became apparent in the Org-Low system, with most of lodging occurring during the vegetative stage. Baby corn grown under high input systems showed increasing lodging from the late vegetative crop stage and peaked before the final harvest. Tunneling was recorded at both sites, but was generally below 5{\%}, with no significant differences between the farming systems. Overall, the injury patterns caused by termites appear to be a function of the plant growth stage, termite colony activities, trial site, and the types and levels of fertilizer input. Thus, the management practice used in each farming system (organic or conventional) might have greater influence on crop injuries than the type of farming system itself or the termite abundance within each system.},

The desire to strengthen farmer access to market has seen the emergence of a number of projects that employ ICT tools in the provision of market information. This study assesses the conditioners of the use of ICT tools in general and mobile phones in particular by smallholder farmers for agricultural transactions. The study finds that several farmer, farm and capital endowment factors affect the use of ICT tools and mobile phones. Specifically, age, occupation, nearness to output market, number of crop enterprises, farming experience literacy and crop income explain the use of tools while gender, nearness to output market, household size, owning a phone, level of literacy, crop income and value of assets explain the intensity of use of the mobile for agricultural transaction purposes. It discusses the implications of these findings for policy.},

abstract = {Increasing tree cover and managing trees better on farms in Ethiopia supports livelihoods and the environment but most tree-planting schemes promote only a few species. This research aimed to understand farmers' tree planting priorities in Oromia, Ethiopia and address challenges involved in meeting them. Tree species and planting niches were elicited through focus group discussions. Participatory trials compared 17 tree species across seven on-farm planting niches and seedling survival and growth patterns were evaluated. Farmers suggested a high diversity of tree species suitable for each niche with fruit species mainly selected for homesteads. The diversity of desired tree species is much higher than that typically available in nurseries or promoted by tree planting projects. Meeting planting demands was difficult because the existing seedling supply does not support diversity. Evaluation of tree survival showed striking differences among species, farms, agroecologies and planting niches. There was high variation in seedling survival amongst the tree species planted on 1893 farm/planting niche locations, indicating impact of local level risk factors attributable to management, biotic and abiotic causes. Growth differences of the six shared species common to both agroecologies across different niches, showed that the effects of species and niche were significant on growth. A farmer-led approach to increasing tree cover that couples understanding of species and planting niche preferences with appropriate seedling supply and management is proposed as a means to increase the diversity of trees in farmed landscapes.},

abstract = {Concerns about the negative impacts of productivist agriculture have led to the emergence of two forms of ecological modernisation of agriculture. The first, efficiency-substitution agriculture, aims to improve input use efficiency and to minimise environmental impacts of modern farming systems. It is currently the dominant modernisation pathway. The second, biodiversity-based agriculture, aims to develop ecosystem services provided by biological diversity. It currently exists only as a niche. Here we review challenges of implementing biodiversity-based agriculture: managing, at the local level, a consistent transition within and among farming systems, supply chains and natural resource management. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing conceptual frameworks developed to analyse farming, social-ecological and socio-technical systems. Then we present an integrative framework tailored for structuring analysis of agriculture from the perspective of developing a territorial biodiversity-based agriculture. In addition, we propose a participatory methodology to design this agroecological transition at the local level. This design methodology was developed to support a multi-stakeholder arena in analysing the current situation, identifying future exogenous changes and designing (1) targeted territorial biodiversity-based agriculture, (2) the pathway of the transition and (3) the required adaptive governance structures and management strategies. We conclude by analysing key challenges of designing such a complex transition, developing multi-actor and multi-domain approaches based on a combination of scientific and experiential knowledge and on building suitable boundary objects (computer-based and conceptual models, indicators, etc.) to assess innovative systems designed by stakeholders.},

abstract = {The appearance of Fall Armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda) in Africa has caused much consternation: “The hungry caterpillar threatening a global food crisis”, according to a headline in the Guardian newspaper. The UK Department for International Development (DFID) commissioned CABI to compile an evidence note, which was published by CABI in September 2017. This article is a summary of the evidence note, which aimed to assess the potential impact of FAW in Africa if left uncontrolled, and recommend and prioritise control options. The first confirmed reports of FAW were from West Africa in early 2016. Research to date suggests that both strains of FAW that are found in the Americas entered Africa, perhaps as stowaways on commercial aircraft, either in cargo containers or airplane holds, before subsequent widespread dispersal by the wind. The probability is high ({\textgreater}90{\%}) that the introduction to Africa was from the characterised Florida strain of FAW, which is restricted to the eastern seaboard of the USA, and the Caribbean islands. Based on information from literature searches, personal communications and internet mining, as for August 2017 28 countries have confirmed the presence of FAW. A further nine countries suspect its presence, or are awaiting official confirmation of the pest in the country. Two countries (Somalia and Djibouti) have conducted surveys and not found any FAW. Using distribution and climate data collected from South America and in Ghana and Zambia, models were used to investigate the environmental (climatic) factors affecting the distribution of FAW. Results from multiple models have been combined to produce an environmental suitability index for FAW across Africa. Fall Armyworm (FAW) in Africa has the potential to cause maize yield losses in a range from 8.3 to 20.6m tonnes per annum, in the absence of any control methods, in just 12 of Africa's maize-producing countries. This represents a range of 21{\%}-53{\%} of the annual production of maize averaged over a three year period in these countries. The value of these potential losses is estimated at between {\$}2,481m and {\$}6,187m. FAW should be expected to spread throughout suitable habitats in mainland sub-Saharan Africa within the next few cropping seasons. Northern Africa and Madagascar are also at risk. As of August 2017, the pest has been confirmed present in 28 countries in Africa (compared to 12 in April 2017), with suspected presence in a further 9 countries. Control of FAW requires an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. Immediate recommendations include (i) awareness raising campaigns on FAW symptoms, early detection and control, including beneficial agronomic practices; (ii) national preparation and communication of a list of recommended, regulated pesticides and biopesticides and their appropriate application methods. Work should also start immediately to (i) assess preferred crop varieties for resistance or tolerance to FAW; (ii) introduce classical biological control agents from the Americas. A conducive policy environment should promote lower risk pest management approaches.},

It is expected that extension programmes will help increase farm productivity, farm revenue, reduce poverty and minimize food insecurity. In this study, we estimate the effects of extension services on farm productivity and income with particular reference to agricultural extension services delivered by Association of Church-based Development NGOs (ACDEP). Methods: The study used cross-sectional data collected from 200 farm households from two districts in the Northern region of Ghana. The robustness of the estimates was tested by the use of regression on covariates, regression on propensity scores and Heckman treatment effect model. Results: The study found positive economic gains from participating in the ACDEP agricultural extension programmes. Apart from the primary variable of interest (ACDEP agricultural extension programme), socio-economic, institutional and farm-specific variables were estimated to significantly affect farmers' farm income depending on the estimation technique used. Conclusions: The study has reaffirmed the critical role of extension programmes in enhancing farm productivity and household income. It is, therefore, recommended that agricultural extension service delivery should be boosted through timely recruitment, periodic training of agents and provision of adequate logistics.},

abstract = {There is a lot of interest in the contribution that agroforestry can make to reverse land degradation and create resilient multifunctional landscapes that provide a range of socio-economic benefits. The agroforestry research agenda has been characterized by approaches that promote a few priority tree species, within a restricted set of technological packages. These have often not spread widely beyond project sites, because they fail to take account of fine scale variation in farmer circumstances. New methods are needed to generate diverse sets of agroforestry options that can reconcile production and conservation objectives and embrace varying local conditions across large scaling domains. Here, we document a novel approach that couples local knowledge acquisition with structured stakeholder engagement to build an inclusive way of designing agroforestry options. We applied this approach in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where armed conflict, erratic governance and poverty have resulted in severe pressure on forests in the Virunga National Park, a global biodiversity hotspot. Around the park, natural resources and land are severely degraded, whereas most reforestation interventions have consisted of exotic monocultures dominated by Eucalyptus species grown as energy or timber woodlots mainly by male farmers with sufficient land to allocate some exclusively to trees. We found that structured stakeholder engagement led to a quick identification of a much greater diversity of trees (more than 70 species) to be recommended for use within varied field, farm and landscape niches, serving the interests of a much greater diversity of people, including women and marginalized groups. The process also identified key interventions to improve the enabling environment required to scale up the adoption of agroforestry. These included improving access to quality tree planting material, capacity strengthening within the largely non-governmental extension system, and collective action to support value capture from agroforestry products, through processing and market interventions. Integrating local and global scientific knowledge, coupled with facilitating broad-based stakeholder participation, resulted in shifting from reliance on a few priority tree species to promoting tree diversity across the Virunga landscape that could underpin more productive and resilient livelihoods. The approach is relevant for scaling up agroforestry more generally.},

abstract = {There is a need for methods to scale up site specific field trial results for maize to larger areas. The objectives of this research for SSA were to establish relationships between maize crop-nutrient response functions and biophysical variables; determine prediction equations for maize crop-nutrient response functions; and extrapolate (predict) maize nutrient response functions using the predictor equations to areas of interest and evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the data. Geo-referenced maize-nutrient response functions of 736, 488, and 152 for N, P and K, respectively, determined from past and recent research results by the project OFRA were used. New geo-referenced 4646 points were identified across SSA to predict crop-nutrient response functions using the prediction equations. The independent variables considered were elevation, location, climate and soil properties and their square and two-way interactions. Data were subjected to GLM at P ≤ 0.05. The coefficients of maize nutrient-response functions model's goodness-of-fits were evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), cross-validated R2 (q2), Ro2 and Ro′2 and RMSE with mean values of 0.67, 0.65, 0.67, 0.68 and 0.16 Mg ha−1, respectively. These values indicate the robustness and predictive ability of the predictive models for the study area conditions. In conclusion, these predictive equations can be used to estimate maize nutrient response functions for important maize growing areas throughout SSA.},

The mean herd size was 2.46, while a proportion of 36.4{\%} and 15{\%} of the animals were lactating cows and heifers respectively. The mean milk yield /cow/day was 6.47 litres with 89.3{\%} of the farms producing less than 10 litres of milk/cow/day. Average quantity of milk produced was 1168 litres/cow/year. Mean lactation length was 7.67 months (230 days) with majority of farms (77.8{\%}) recording a lactation period of 5-7 months (150-210 days). The mean calving interval was 14.77 months (430 days) with a range of 12-36, while mean age at first calving was 28.16 months with a range of 24-38 months. 98{\%} of the farms used Napier grass as the main fodder. The study concluded that the low performance of dairy herds in the region may be attributed to type of breeds kept, low numbers of lactating cows and replacement heifers, short lactation period and utilization of low quality feed resources. It is recommended that management skills, strong institutional linkages, support for commercial rearing of dairy breeding stock, and feeds diversification programme should be developed to improve performance of dairy herds in the region.},

abstract = {Accurate spatial information of agricultural fields in smallholder farms is important for providing actionable information to farmers, managers, and policymakers. Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images can capture such information. However, the automated delineation of fields in smallholder farms is a challenging task because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems, which make their boundaries vaguely defined. Physical edges between smallholder fields are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours need to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural pattern between fields. In these circumstances, standard edge-detection algorithms fail to extract accurate boundaries. This article introduces a strategy to detect field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalisation and grouping algorithm. The convolutional network using an encoder-decoder structure is capable of learning complex spatial-contextual features from the image and accurately detects sparse field contours. A hierarchical segmentation is derived from the contours using the oriented watershed transform and by iteratively merging adjacent regions based on the average strength of their common boundary. Finally, field segments are obtained by adopting a combinatorial grouping algorithm exploiting the information of the segmentation hierarchy. An extensive experimental analysis is performed in two study areas in Nigeria and Mali using WorldView-2/3 images and comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on the precision-recall accuracy assessment strategy which is tolerating small localisation errors in the detected contours. The proposed strategy shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with F-scores higher than 0.7 and 0.6 on our two test areas, respectively, outperforming alternative techniques.},

Based on a co-constructed analytical approach relying on empirical information from ten cases from the Global South, we find that plural valuation contributes to equitable and sustainable outcomes if the valuation process: 1) is based on participatory value elicitation approaches; 2) is framed with a clear action-oriented purpose; 3) provides space for marginalized stakeholders to articulate their values in ways that can be included in decisions; 4) is used as a tool to identify and help reconcile different cognitive models about human-nature relations; and 5) fosters open communication and collaboration among stakeholders.

abstract = {It was suggested that the factors that confer resistance on a maize variety against Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky are chemically based. To test this hypothesis, resistance indices of the weevil were assessed using a new scale developed by Nwosu et al. (2015a) after performing detailed chemical analysis of the whole-maize grain using twenty elite maize varieties under ambient temperature and relative humidity of 30.7 °C and 74.5{\%} respectively. Increases in maize varietal crude fibre, phenolic acid and trypsin inhibitor increased significantly mortality of S. zeamais adults and reduced significantly survival rate of S. zeamais adults, percent of grain damage, percent of weight loss, weight of grain flour and oviposition by the adult females. The level of cystein proteinase inhibitor (a natural protectant of plants against insect attack) in the grains was not on its own responsible for increased mortality, reduced grain damage and reduced oviposition. The study identified crude fibre, phenolic acid and trypsin inhibitor of whole-maize grain as the bases for resistance. Their significant increase in grains resulted in low infestation. Whereas, increased protein, zinc, magnesium, calcium, sodium, phosphorus, manganese, iron, cobalt and starch rendered the elite maize grains susceptible to S. zeamais attack. Therefore, significant incorporation of the bases for resistance and significant reduction of the bases for susceptibility in maize grains during breeding programmes is advocated; provided this does not adversely affect palatability and nutritional needs of man. Eighty-five percent of the elite maize varieties were at least resistant to S. zeamais infestation and damage.

abstract = {Climate change threatens ecosystems, including traditional agroforestry parklands. Assessing the level of vulnerability and resilience of any ecosystem to climate change is important for designing sustainable adaptation strategies and measures. We assessed farmers' perceptions of the vulnerability of agroforestry systems to climate change in Benin. The objectives of the study were to (i) assess the effect of changes in climatic conditions on agroforestry systems, (ii) assess the endogenous indicators of vulnerability of agroforestry systems to climate change, and (iii) analyze agroforestry and cropping systems' resilience to climate change. We hypothesized that some agroforestry systems are more resilient to climate change than others. A total of 233 household heads were surveyed, and seven agroforestry systems were assessed. Data collected included components, indicators of vulnerability, and the level of resilience of agroforestry systems. We characterized the agroforestry systems using a proportion of each woody trees species and density of tree. We differentiated the agroforestry systems with regard to vulnerability indicators using canonical factorial discriminant analysis with heplots for pairs of discriminant variables. The resilience of agroforestry and cropping systems was evaluated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0—not resilient to 3—most resilient). The number of components damaged in the system was the main indicator of the vulnerability of Anacardium occidentale and Citrus sinensis parks to climate change effects. Local people perceived age and density of Vitellaria paradoxa parks and mixed parks (Vitellaria paradoxa–Parkia biglobosa) as factors determining the vulnerability of these agroforestry systems to the effects of climate change. All agroforestry systems were perceived to be resilient to climate change but in different degrees. Manihot esculenta was reported as the most resilient crop to climate damage. For the first time, we found out specific endogenous indicators of the vulnerability of agroforestry systems to climate change, which are important to identify better adaptation strategies.},

abstract = {Crop residues are a key livelihood resource in smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity.},

This article quantifies the impacts of soil characteristics on maize response to fertilizer in Zambia using a nationally representative sample of 1453 fields, combining economic, farm management and soil analysis data. Depending on soil regimes, average maize yield response estimates range from insignificant (0) to 7 maize kg per fertilizer kg. For the majority of farmers, the estimated average value cost ratio is between 1 and 2, meaning fertilizer use would be fiscally rational, barring uncertainty and transfer costs. Since transfer costs exist and outcomes are uncertain, however, many farmers may sensibly pause before deciding whether to adopt fertilizer. This suggests shifting the emphasis of chronically low fertilizer use in Africa away from explanations of “market failure” toward greater emphasis on improving fertilizer efficacy.},

This study was conducted to determine the level of adoption of tree nursery practices in the MVP Project. Exploratory survey involving purposive sampling of 31{\%} households in the MVP and use of semi-structured questionnaires, interviews and focus group discussions was employed to collect data following validity and reliability tests. The resulting data were subjected to descriptive analysis using SPSS version 22 and differences between independent variables tested by Chi-square analysis (a =0.05). The most preferred tree species were Cupressus lusitanica (66.9{\%}), Eucalyptus grandis (56.4{\%}) and Grevillea robusta (43.1{\%}). Farmers were not able to propagate some preferred trees due to unavailability of seeds (e.g. Grevillea robusta), lack of knowledge on vegetative propagation of the tree species (e.g. Casuarina equisetifolia), slow growth (e.g. Acacia nilotica), and seeds taking too long to germinate (e.g. Mangifera indica). Tree nursery operators in the region used locally-sourced seeds as a means of raising seedlings, without taking into consideration the genetic attributes of the germplasm used. Tree nursery enterprise at the millennium village has great potential as an economic venture, with a total net annual return of Ksh. 4, 976, 854.00 above total cost, translating into Ksh 27, 496.50 per capita at the village level. The most important challenges facing the adoption of tree nursery enterprise at the MVP are pests, scarcity of water and lack of adequate space for nurseries. This study recommends certification of tree nursery operators and development of tree germplasm tracking systems for quality assurance and marketing purposes as well as intensification of extension services and awareness campaigns for increased afforestation and attainment of at least 10{\%} tree cover in Siaya County, and the rest of the Country.},

Based on a co-constructed analytical approach relying on empirical information from ten cases from the Global South, we find that plural valuation contributes to equitable and sustainable outcomes if the valuation process: 1) is based on participatory value elicitation approaches; 2) is framed with a clear action-oriented purpose; 3) provides space for marginalized stakeholders to articulate their values in ways that can be included in decisions; 4) is used as a tool to identify and help reconcile different cognitive models about human-nature relations; and 5) fosters open communication and collaboration among stakeholders.

abstract = {Rapid climatic and socio-economic changes challenge current agricultural R{\&}D capacity. The necessary quantum leap in knowledge generation should build on the innovation capacity of farmers themselves. A novel citizen science methodology, triadic comparisons of technologies or tricot, was implemented in pilot studies in India, East Africa, and Central America. The methodology involves distributing a pool of agricultural technologies in different combinations of three to individual farmers who observe these technologies under farm conditions and compare their performance. Since the combinations of three technologies overlap, statistical methods can piece together the overall performance ranking of the complete pool of technologies. The tricot approach affords wide scaling, as the distribution of trial packages and instruction sessions is relatively easy to execute, farmers do not need to be organized in collaborative groups, and feedback is easy to collect, even by phone. The tricot approach provides interpretable, meaningful results and was widely accepted by farmers. The methodology underwent improvement in data input formats. A number of methodological issues remain: integrating environmental analysis, capturing gender-specific differences, stimulating farmers' motivation, and supporting implementation with an integrated digital platform. Future studies should apply the tricot approach to a wider range of technologies, quantify its potential contribution to climate adaptation, and embed the approach in appropriate institutions and business models, empowering participants and democratizing science.},

The outlook for agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa is situated in the context of several mega-trends that shape the sector's development. These include rapid population growth, urbanisation and rural diversification, an associated structural transformation from farm to non-farm employment, a growing middle class, and increasing interest (both domestically and globally) in the continent's farmland. The Outlook for agriculture is broadly positive, but could be further enhanced by consistent policies and strategic investments, in particular in rural infrastructure.

abstract = {Understanding the structure, densities and utilization of tree populations in agricultural landscapes is useful in determining the species influencing agroecosystem function. Our study evaluated agroforestry adoption and practices within smallholder farms in a former large-scale maize growing area of Trans Nzoia County, Rift Valley Province, Kenya. This was followed by investigation of factors influencing heterogeneity in the adoption and practices. The factors include: household resource endowment, land tenure and time under current management. Five settlement schemes which were formerly large estates dominated by maize mono-cropping were selected for the current study. Tree inventories of the farms were obtained through transect walks across each settlement. A total of 123 farms were assessed representing households of different resource endowment levels, tenure and number of years under current management. Different analyses were carried out including farm size and tree number, tree density, tree diversity and utilization of the dominant tree species. In total, we identified 44 tree/shrub species, 24 of which were indigenous and the rest exotic. However, the exotic tree species dominated strongly in abundance with Eucalyptus spp. being the most frequent taxon and constituting 34.6{\%} of all trees. Species richness was found to be low compared to other agricultural landscapes in the region. Resource constrained households were found to prefer fruit tree species and maintained high tree diversity on their farms. Households with secure tenure had higher tree diversity than those without who had higherspecies richness and opted for fast growing fodder and fertilizer/firewood trees. Younger farms had fewer trees but higher species richness than older farms. The study, therefore, explains heterogeneity in agroforestry adoption in terms of variation in household resource endowment, land tenure and time under current management levels.},

Design/methodology/approach: The characteristics that fostered co-innovation in each innovation project case study were identified from semi-structured interviews conducted with key stakeholders in each project, iterative discussions to confirm the findings and secondary document analysis. Common themes from the three cases are examined in relation to innovation system structure and function analysis and agricultural innovation system (AIS) literature. This study builds on the literature attempting to overcome methodological challenges in the applied AIS research space. Findings: The findings have implications for co-innovation in practice; that there needs to be network-level capability and legitimacy, an understanding of priorities between actors, and adequate resources, to ensure proposed outcomes are likely to be attained. Practical implications: Practically, project leaders need to ensure they embed an appropriate mix of actors in the research program and they also need to create and encourage room for open and honest dialogue between these actors to develop a shared vision of the future. Theoretical implications: A conceptual model is developed to highlight and simplify lessons that can inform future projects involving co-innovation approaches to create value in the primary industries and AIS more generally. This model is unique to the applied AIS research space and provides new insights on enhancing the potential value of a co-innovation approach. Originality/value: The paper adds to current scholarly debates and provides insight to key actions stakeholders need to take to foster co-innovation processes for successful outcomes in extension.},

abstract = {Grain legumes play a key role in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in relation to food and nutrition security and income generation. Moreover, because of their N2-fixation capacity, such legumes can also have a positive influence on soil fertility. Notwithstanding many decades of research on the agronomy of grain legumes, their N2-fixation capacity, and their contribution to overall system productivity, several issues remain to be resolved to realize fully the benefits of grain legumes. In this paper we highlight major lessons learnt and expose key knowledge gaps in relation to grain legumes and their contributions to farming system productivity. The symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia forms the basis for its benefits and biological N2-fixation (BNF) relies as much on the legume genotype as on the rhizobial strains. As such, breeding grain legumes for BNF deserves considerably more attention. Even promiscuous varieties usually respond to inoculation, and as African soils contain a huge pool of unexploited biodiversity with potential to contribute elite rhizobial strains, strain selection should go hand-in-hand with legume breeding for N2-fixation. Although inoculated strains can outcompete indigenous strains, our understanding of what constitutes a good competitor is rudimentary, as well as which factors affect the persistence of inoculated rhizobia, which in its turn determines whether a farmer needs to re-inoculate each and every season. Although it is commonly assumed that indigenous rhizobia are better adapted to local conditions than elite strains used in inoculants, there is little evidence that this is the case. The problems of delivering inoculants to smallholders through poorly-developed supply chains in Africa necessitates inoculants based on sterile carriers with long shelf life. Other factors critical for a well-functioning symbiosis are also central to the overall productivity of grain legumes. Good agronomic practices, including the use of phosphorus (P)-containing fertilizer, improve legume yields though responses to inputs are usually very variable. In some situations, a considerable proportion of soils show no response of legumes to applied inputs, often referred to as non-responsive soils. Understanding the causes underlying this phenomenon is limited and hinders the uptake of legume agronomy practices. Grain legumes also contribute to the productivity of farming systems, although such effects are commonly greater in rotational than in intercropping systems. While most cropping systems allow for the integration of legumes, intercropped legumes provide only marginal benefits to associated crops. Important rotational benefits have been shown for most grain legumes though those with the highest N accumulation and lowest N harvest index appear to demonstrate higher residual benefits. N balance estimates often results in contradictory observations, mostly caused by the lack of understanding of belowground contributions of legumes to the N balance. Lastly, the ultimate condition for increased uptake of grain legumes by smallholder farmers lies in the understanding of how legume technologies and management practices can be tailored to the enormous diversity of agroecologies, farming systems, and smallholder farms in SSA. In conclusion, while research on grain legumes has revealed a number of important insights that will guide realization of the full potential of such legumes to the sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in SSA, many research challenges remain to be addressed to realize the full potential of BNF in these systems.},

At this moment this is a rather top-down system for the transfer of technologies, but the Ministry is convinced that the extension system would become more effective if it was more participatory and demand-driven. The Village Extension Officers are taught impact points, which they are expected to pass on to the farmers. However, most farmers do not follow these recommendations, often because in formulating these recommendations one has not given enough attention to the limited possibilities many farmers have to make investments. With the large diversity among the farmers in income, access to markets and agro-ecological situation blanket recommendations cannot work. Farmers need information that helps them to make better decisions themselves adjusted to their goals and their situation. This can only be realised with a decentralised system of decision-making in the extension service and a participatory system of supervision and in-service training. Discussed are difficulties involved in realising such a major change in the extension approach.

abstract = {The processes of nutrient depletion and soil degradation that limit productivity of smallholder African farms are spatially heterogeneous. Causes of variability in soil fertility management at different scales of analysis are both biophysical and socio-economic. Such heterogeneity is categorised in this study, which quantifies its impact on nutrient flows and soil fertility status at region and farm scales, as a first step in identifying spatial and temporal niches for targeting of soil fertility management strategies and technologies. Transects for soil profile observation, participatory rural appraisal techniques and classical soil sampling and chemical analysis were sampled across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka), which together represent much of the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Five representative farm types were identified using socio-economic information and considering production activities, household objectives and the main constraints faced by farmers. Soil fertility management and nutrient resource flows were studied for each farm type and related to differences in soil fertility status at farm scale. Farm types 1 and 2 were the wealthiest; the former relied on off-farm income and farmed small pieces of land (0.6-1.1 ha) while the latter farmed relatively large land areas (1.6-3.8 ha) mainly with cash crops. The poorest farm type 5 also farmed small pieces of land (0.4-1.0 ha) but relied on low wages derived from working for wealthier farmers. Both farm types 1 and 5 relied on off-farm earnings and sold the least amounts of farm produce to the market, though the magnitude of their cash, labour and nutrient flows was contrasting. Farms of types 3 and 4 were intermediate in size and wealth, and represented different crop production strategies for self-consumption and the market. Average grain yields fluctuated around 1 t ha-1 year -1 for all farm types and sub-locations. Grain production by farms of types 4 and 5 was much below annual family requirements, estimated at 170 kg person-1 year-1. Household wealth and production orientation affected the pattern of resource flow at farm scale. In the land-constrained farms of type 1, mineral fertilisers were often used more intensively (ca. 50 kg ha-1), though with varying application rates (14-92 kg ha-1). The use of animal manure in such small farms (e.g. 2.2 t year-1) represented intensities of use of up to 8 t ha -1, and a net accumulation of C and macronutrients brought into the farm by livestock. In farms of type 5, intensities of use of mineral and organic fertilisers ranged between 0-12 kg ha-1 and 0-0.5 t ha-1, respectively. A consistent trend of decreasing input use from farm types 1-5 was generally observed, but nutrient resources and land management practices (e.g. fallow) differed enormously between sub-locations. Inputs of nutrients were almost nil in Aludeka farms. Both inherent soil properties and management explained the variability found in soil fertility status. Texture explained the variation observed in soil C and related total N between sub-locations, whereas P availability varied mainly between farm types as affected by input use. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Over the last decades, participatory approaches involving on-farm experimentation have become more prevalent in agricultural research. Nevertheless, these approaches remain difficult to scale because they usually require close attention from well-trained professionals. Novel large-N participatory trials, building on recent advances in citizen science and crowdsourcing methodologies, involve large numbers of participants and little researcher supervision. Reduced supervision may affect data quality, but the “Wisdom of Crowds” principle implies that many independent observations from a diverse group of people often lead to highly accurate results when taken together. In this study, we test whether farmer-generated data in agricultural citizen science are good enough to generate valid statements about the research topic. We experimentally assess the accuracy of farmer observations in trials of crowdsourced crop variety selection that use triadic comparisons of technologies (tricot). At five sites in Honduras, 35 farmers (women and men) participated in tricot experiments. They ranked three varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) for Plant vigor, Plant architecture, Pest resistance, and Disease resistance. Furthermore, with a simulation approach using the empirical data, we did an order-of-magnitude estimation of the sample size of participants needed to produce relevant results. Reliability of farmers' experimental observations was generally low (Kendall's W 0.174 to 0.676). But aggregated observations contained information and had sufficient validity (Kendall's tau coefficient 0.33 to 0.76) to identify the correct ranking orders of varieties by fitting Mallows-Bradley-Terry models to the data. Our sample size simulation shows that low reliability can be compensated by engaging higher numbers of observers to generate statistically meaningful results, demonstrating the usefulness of the Wisdom of Crowds principle in agricultural research. In this first study on data quality from a farmer citizen science methodology, we show that realistic numbers of less than 200 participants can produce meaningful results for agricultural research by tricot-style trials.},

The retrieval chain is based on a hybrid method inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model (RTM) with Random forests (RF) regression. A major feature of this work is the implementation of a retrieval chain exploiting the GEE capabilities using global and climate data records (CDR) of both MODIS surface reflectance and LAI/FAPAR datasets allowing the global estimation of biophysical variables at unprecedented timeliness. We combine a massive global compilation of leaf trait measurements (TRY), which is the baseline for more realistic leaf parametrization for the considered RTM, with large amounts of remote sensing data ingested by GEE. Moreover, the proposed retrieval chain includes the estimation of both FVC and CWC, which are not operationally produced for the MODIS sensor. The derived global estimates are validated over the BELMANIP2.1 sites network by means of an inter-comparison with the MODIS LAI/FAPAR product available in GEE. Overall, the retrieval chain exhibits great consistency with the reference MODIS product (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.54 m2/m2 and ME = 0.03 m2/m2 in the case of LAI, and R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.09 and ME = 0.05 in the case of FAPAR). The analysis of the results by land cover type shows the lowest correlations between our retrievals and the MODIS reference estimates (R2 = 0.42 and R2 = 0.41 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) for evergreen broadleaf forests. These discrepancies could be attributed mainly to different product definitions according to the literature. The provided results proof that GEE is a suitable high performance processing tool for global biophysical variable retrieval for a wide range of applications.},

The assets that biological research funding produces are the data generated, the information derived from these data, and, ultimately, the discoveries and knowledge these lead to. From the time when Henry Oldenburg published the first scientific journal in 1665 (Proceedings of the Royal Society) to the founding of the United States National Library of Medicine in 1879 to the present, there has been a sustained drive to improve how researchers can record and discover what is known. Researchers' experimental work builds upon years and (collectively) billions of dollars' worth of earlier work. Today, researchers are generating data at ever-faster rates because of advances in instrumentation and technology, coupled with decreases in production costs. Unfortunately, the ability of researchers to manage and disseminate their results has not kept pace, so their work cannot achieve its maximal impact. Strides have recently been made, but more awareness is needed of the essential role that biological data resources, including biocuration, play in maintaining and linking this ever-growing flood of data and information. The aim of this paper is to describe the nature of data as an asset, the role biocurators play in increasing its value, and consistent, practical means to measure effectiveness that can guide planning and justify costs in biological research information resources' development and management.},

The group consisted of a mixture of experts with backgrounds in research, academia, government, farmers and development practitioners, and the book reflects the knowledge and perspectives of these various groups. The book begins by describing the rationale behind the initiative followed by a clarification on the background and approach taken. Chapter three then describes the Eastern African region and argues why there is a need to build resilience in the livelihoods of communities living in drylands. Chapter four builds on this by introducing an ecosystem services perspective as the conceptual framework to explore the resilience offered by trees. Chapter five reviews the ecology, distribution and use of trees throughout the Eastern African region. Chapter six uses an ecosystem service perspective to review the various benefits that people derive from dryland trees. Chapter seven draws on experiences gained in development practices and presents and reviews 11 case studies of natural resource management. Chapter eight presents reflections of the write-shop participants on how best practice in resilience-building could be scaled up. A review of knowledge and information gaps regarding the contribution of trees in building resilience is presented in chapter nine, which is followed by a plan for possible follow-up action in chapter ten.{\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}n},

The software grew to consist of several hundred thousand lines of code in multiple programming languages. This has led to a large, complex software ecosystem that is difficult to maintain. In addition, systems modellers increasingly require software systems that integrate multiple disciplines, can represent evermore complex farming systems, can run on multiple operating systems (desktop, web, mobile), can operate at or be adjusted to multiple temporal and spatial scales (field, farm, region, continent, global) and run faster for larger simulation analyses. This is difficult to achieve in an aging framework. For these reasons, the APSIM Initiative is building the next generation of APSIM. This manuscript outlines the approach taken and lessons learnt.},

Field trials were conducted on-farm in Nyanza Province to investigate the effects of phosphate fertilizers and manure on maize yields. The experimental design was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with maize as the test crop. The maize was top dressed with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) fertilizer at a uniform rate of 30 kg N/ha diammonium phosphate (DAP), Minjingu rock phosphate (MRP) and triple super phosphate (TSP) fertilizers were applied at 60 kg/ha P 2 O 5 , farmyard manure (FYM) at 10 t/ha and a non-phosphorus (P) treatment (control) plus lime only. Responses (P ≤ 0.01) from grain yield, total dry matter yield and harvest index to phosphate fertilizers and manure treatments were found. Nutrient uptake and removal by the crop increased (P ≤ 0.01) due to fertilizers and manure application. Phosphate fertilizers and manure application increased (P ≤ 0.01)) available soil P, agronomic phosphorus use efficiency (APUE) and Physiological P use efficiency (PPUE). The results indicate that phosphate fertilizers and manure applications are essential to improve maize yield and nutrient P use efficiency.},

abstract = {Human activities change the structure and function of the environment with cascading impacts on human health, a concept known as “planetary health.” Agroforestry—the management of trees with crops and livestock—alters microclimates, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biodiversity. Besides the nutritional benefits of increased fruit consumption, however, the ways agroforestry affects human health are rarely articulated. This review makes that link. We analyze the pathways through which tree-based farm and landscape change affect food and nutrition security, the spread of infectious disease, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, and human migration in Sub-Saharan Africa. The available evidence suggests that, despite some increased risks of infectious disease, agroforestry is likely to improve a diverse range of pressing health concerns. We therefore examine the factors determining agroforestry use and identify three drivers of social and environmental change that will determine the future uptake of agroforestry in the region. Thirty percent of Sub-Saharan Africa's cropland has at least 10{\%} tree cover. The available evidence indicates that agroforestry drives environmental change, which can improve a diverse range of pressing health concerns such as malnutrition, spread of infectious disease, prevalence of non-communicable disease, and human migration. This, however, does not always apply: transdisciplinary, participatory approaches are needed to dive more deeply into specific land-management systems to identify synergies and tradeoffs among health outcomes.},

abstract = {A sufficient intake of fruits can alleviate micronutrient deficiencies and reduces the risks of a number of associated diseases. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, however, the production and consumption of fruits are inadequate on average and in particular so in specific seasons. To better incorporate fruits into local food systems while addressing the challenge of seasonal availability, World Agroforestry (ICRAF) has developed a methodology based on “fruit tree portfolios” that selects socio-ecologically suitable and nutritionally important fruit tree species for farm production, to meet local consumption needs. We here present this approach and illustrate it with data from a case study involving Western and Eastern Kenya. The approach uses mixed methods to capture on-farm fruit tree diversity and seasonality at a household level (n = 600 in our case study), the months of household's food security and insecurity (n = 600) and food consumption patterns at an individual level, to identify dietary gaps (n = 294 women and child pairs in our example). In our case study, 31 fruit tree species were reported on farms in our Western Kenya sample (9 of which were indigenous) and 51 (27 indigenous) in Eastern Kenya. In addition, the median number of food-insecure months per household was four (ranging from 0 to 9 months) in Eastern Kenya and three (0 to 12 months) in Western Kenya. Finally, using 24-h recalls the proportion of women that had consumed a fruit the day before the interview was around 55{\%} in Western Kenya and 80{\%} in Eastern Kenya, with consumption averaging 93 and 131 g, respectively. Using these parameters for each site and fruit tree phenology and food composition data sets, we derived context-specific recommendations that involve promoting 11 fruit tree species to address micronutrient gaps.},

abstract = {The large diversity of farms and farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa calls for agricultural improvement options that are adapted to the context in which smallholder farmers operate. The socio-ecological niche concept incorporates the agro-ecological, socio-cultural, economic and institutional dimensions and the multiple levels of this context in order to identify which options fit best. In this paper, we illustrate how farming systems analysis, following the DEED cycle of Describe, Explain, Explore and Design, and embedding co-learning amongst researchers, farmers and other stakeholders, helps to operationalize the socio-ecological niche concept. Examples illustrate how farm typologies, detailed farm characterization and on-farm experimental work, in combination with modelling and participatory approaches inform the matching of options to the context at regional, village, farm and field level. Recommendation domains at these gradually finer levels form the basis for gradually more detailed baskets of options from which farmers and other stakeholders may choose, test and adjust to their specific needs. Tailored options identified through the DEED cycle proof to be more relevant, feasible and performant as compared to blanket recommendations in terms of both researcher and farmer-identified criteria. As part of DEED, on-farm experiments are particularly useful in revealing constraints and risks faced by farmers. We show that targeting options to the niches in which they perform best, helps to reduce this risk. Whereas the conclusions of our work about the potential for improving smallholders' livelihoods are often sobering, farming systems analysis allows substantiating the limitations of technological options, thus highlighting the need for enabling policies and institutions that may improve the larger-scale context and increase the uptake potential of options.},

abstract = {Social norms surrounding women's and men's mobility in public spaces often differ. Here we discuss how gendered mobilities and immobilities influence women's and men's capacities to innovate in agriculture. We analyze four case studies from Western Kenya and Southwestern Nigeria that draw on 28 focus group discussions and 32 individual interviews with a total of 225 rural and peri-urban women, men and youth. Findings show that women in both sites are less mobile than men due to norms that delimit the spaces where they can go, the purpose, length of time and time of day of their travels. Overall, Kenyan women and Nigerian men have better access to agricultural services and farmer groups than their gendered counterparts. In Southwestern Nigeria this is linked to masculine roles of heading and providing for the household and in Western Kenya to the construction of women as the ‘developers' of their households. Access and group participation may reflect norms and expectations to fulfill gender roles rather than an individual's agency. This may (re)produce mobility pressures on time constrained gendered subjects. Frameworks to analyze factors that support women's and men's agency should be used to understand how gendered mobilities and immobilities are embedded in community contexts and affect engagement in agricultural innovation. This can inform the design of interventions to consider the ways in which norms and agency intersect and influence women's and men's mobilities, hence capacity to innovate in agriculture, thus supporting more gender transformative approaches.},

A structured literature review (1995–2014) assessed 350 journal articles about provision of one or more ESs by trees on farms and in agricultural landscapes in SSA. This revealed information on 15 ESs from studies in 23 countries covering arid (1{\%} of studies), semi-arid (49{\%}), sub-humid (26{\%}) and humid (24{\%}) agro-ecological zones. The majority of the studies reported provisioning (39{\%}) and supporting (35{\%}) followed by regulating (26{\%}) ESs while studies on cultural services were scarce. Beneficial impacts of trees were dominating (58{\%}), in particular in semi-arid zones where they were associated with enhancing water and nutrient cycling. A decline in some ESs was reported in 15{\%} of the studies, while 28{\%} found no effect of trees. Although the effects of trees were mainly positive, a decline in crop production was noted as a key trade-off against the provisions of ESs, such as modification of microclimate. This highlights the need to manage trade-offs among impacts of trees on ES provision to reduce competition and increase complementarity between trees and crops.},

abstract = {This paper analyses how farming systems in Siaya District have evolved and resulted in environmental degradation, what farmers' perceptions are of soil fertility decline and how they manage it. The farming system in Siaya has evolved from shifting cultivation via fallow-based farming to permanent agriculture, mainly due to increasing population pressure and market integration. Long fallow periods were used to regenerate the level of organic matter and nutrients, until increasing pressure on land reduced its potential. Thereafter, application of animal manure became the most important source for soil fertility amendment. However, due to the decline in cattle population quantities of manure produced have become insufficient for restoring soil fertility on all fields. Most farmers find inorganic fertilizer too expensive. The criteria that farmers use for judging that soil fertility is declining include reduced crop yields, change in soil colour, compacting of the soil, and the presence of certain weed species. They respond in various ways: parts of their land may be put into fallow for a period of at least six months; farmers also practise organic matter recycling, crop rotation, and crop associations. Soil and water conservation structures are established to avoid nutrient losses. More radical strategies include the development of low-lying, swampy land for growing high value vegetables or the search for off-farm employment. Technologies developed by research institutes focus on improved fallow systems and green manure with leguminous shrubs and herbs. First results show a great potential for restoring soil fertility and improving crop yields. Improved fallow is produced primarily with Sesbania sesban for 6 or 12 months. Biomass for green manuring is cut from existing hedgerows in Siaya, especially Tithonia. However, this technology is very labour intensive. The amounts of biomass needed can be reduced when combined with inorganic fertilizers. Further improvements in crop yields may be achieved by adding rock phosphate and manure.},

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to explore how the relative yield of legumes and cereals in mixtures responds to relative sowing time, relative density and nitrogen fertilizer. An index for relative sowing time, RST, was developed to quantify the relative difference in sowing time between the intercropped species. RST is defined as the amount of time that a species is sown earlier or later than its companion species, relative to the length of its own growing period. RST is smaller than zero if a species is sown earlier than its companion species and greater than zero if it is sown later. Relative performance of a species was characterized by its relative yield (or partial land equivalent ratio, PLER) in the intercrop compared to the yield in the sole crop. In 409 out of 552 cases, the cereal had a greater relative yield than the legume. Sowing a species earlier than its companion increased its relative yield, and vice versa. An increase in density of a species increased its relative yield and decreased the relative yield of the companion species. The relative yield of cereals increased and that of legumes decreased with the amount of N fertilizer. The negative effect of N on the relative yield of legumes was mitigated if the legume was sown before the cereal. The study shows how the performance of cereals and legumes in an intercrop is affected by sowing densities, relative sowing times, and nitrogen fertilizer. Growers can exploit these relationships to manage competition between cereals and legumes in mixtures and enhance species complementarity, total productivity and economic profit.},

abstract = {Secondary and micronutrients are important in enhancing crop productivity; yet, they are hardly studied in sub-Sahara Africa. In this region, the main focus has been on macronutrients but there is emerging though scattered evidence of crop productivity limitations by the secondary and micronutrients. Elsewhere, widespread deficiencies of these nutrients are associated with stagnation of yields. Here, we undertake a meta-analysis using 40 articles reporting crop response to secondary and micronutrients to (1) determine the productivity increase of crops and nutrient use efficiency associated with these nutrients, and (2) provide synthesis of responses to secondary nutrients and micronutrients in sub-Sahara Africa. This study used 757 yield data rows (530 from publications and 227 from Africa Soil Information Service) from field trials carried out in SSA between 1969 and 2013 in 14 countries. Data from publications constituted response to S (49.4{\%}), Zn (23.0{\%}), S and micronutrient combinations (11.5{\%}), and {\textless}10{\%} each for Cu, Mo, Fe, and B. Data from Africa Soil Information Service were all for S and micronutrient combinations. Of the two sources, most yield data are for maize (73.6{\%}), followed by sorghum (6.7{\%}) and wheat (6.1{\%}) while rice, cowpea, faba bean, tef, and soybean each accounted for less than 5{\%}. The major points are the following: (1) application of S and micronutrients increased maize yield by 0.84 t ha−1 (i.e., 25{\%}) over macronutrient only treatment and achieved agronomic efficiencies (kilograms of grain increase per kilogram of micronutrient added) between 38 and 432 and (2) response ratios were {\textgreater}1 for S and all micronutrients, i.e., the probability of response ratio exceeding 1 was 0.77 for S and 0.83 for Zn, 0.95 for Cu, and 0.92 for Fe, and indicates positive crop response for a majority of farmers. We conclude that S and micronutrients are holding back crop productivity especially on soils where response to macronutrients is low and that more research is needed to unravel conditions under which application of S and micronutrients may pose financial risks.},

abstract = {Most of the world's extreme poor, surviving on US{\$}1.25 or less per day, live in rural areas and farm for a living. Many suffer chronic poverty that lasts for years or generations, rather than the transitory poverty that dominates developed, urban economies. Such chronic, structural poverty arises when an individual's productive assets-such as their ability to work or their soils-and the technologies and markets that transform their assets into food and income are insufficient to attain satisfactory living standards. Research reveals strong links between economic status and soil quality, and these can be self-reinforcing. For example, poor soil constrains agricultural production and household capital, and low household capital constrains investments in improving soils. Price, availability and access to credit can limit farmers' applications of nutrients, which are often the primary constraint on agricultural productivity. Soil micronutrient deficiencies can lead to dietary mineral deficiencies and negative health outcomes that further constrain productivity and household asset accumulation. Soils may also be important for smallholder resilience to stressors and shocks. For example, high-quality soil can reduce vulnerability to drought, and insurance against risk may promote investment in soils. Interventions such as fertilizer subsidies, micronutrient-fortified fertilizer and improved access to information, insurance and credit may all help break the soil-poverty cycle.},

Biodiversity, consumers, education and governance are identified as promising entry points to build a structured process using visual narratives that rely on the 10 Elements of Agroecology to graphically dissect prospective social-ecological transition trajectories. We illustrate such applications with examples from agroforestry worldwide, public food procurement in Brazil and the United States of America, and agroecology education vis-{\`{a}}-vis secure access to land in Senegal.

abstract = {Maize is the most important food crop in Tanzania, covering 45{\%} of the cultivated area. Maize farmers have adopted many improved maize varieties but different studies have produced different estimates of adoption rates. A survey was, therefore, conducted in 2001 to estimate the area in improved maize seed, to collect opinions regarding maize recycling, constraints to production and strategies to obtain improved maize seed. The seed sector sold an average 7,750 tons of improved maize seed per year from 1997 to 2000, but also indicate a clear negative trend in sales. While during the 1997/1998 season 9,500 tons were sold, it was reduced to 6,660 tons in the last season. Although the amount of hybrid seed sold was roughly the same for the three seasons, it was the sales of open pollinated varieties (OPVs) that decreased to less than a half in the third year. Based on an estimated national maize area of 2 million ha and a seed rate of 15 kg/ha, the estimate of the area planted with fresh improved maize seed was 26{\%}. Considering the use of OPVs that have been recycled for two years, the area grown with improved maize seed was 46{\%}. Drought, low prices of the produce, pests and diseases, and high input prices were mentioned by the extension officers as the most important constraints for maize production. The high costs of improved seed, poor availability and lack of knowledge were some of the reasons why farmers did not use improved seed. The major strategies farmers use to obtain improved seed were purchase from agro-dealers, recycling of their own seed, and the formation of Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOs). Since the survey, seed sales have increased but this increase is mostly in hybrids, and has been accompanied by an increase in area , so the proportion of maize area in improved varieties remains at a low 27{\%}. Research and development efforts should, therefore, be directed to solve the farmers{\&}rsquo; major production constraints such as drought, lack of markets and low produce prices, and pests and diseases. Knowledge of how to obtain and grow improved varieties, including good husbandry practices, is critical in adopting improved varieties.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$tKey words: Survey, improved maize seed, adoption rate, Tanzania.},

The assets that biological research funding produces are the data generated, the information derived from these data, and, ultimately, the discoveries and knowledge these lead to. From the time when Henry Oldenburg published the first scientific journal in 1665 (Proceedings of the Royal Society) to the founding of the United States National Library of Medicine in 1879 to the present, there has been a sustained drive to improve how researchers can record and discover what is known. Researchers' experimental work builds upon years and (collectively) billions of dollars' worth of earlier work. Today, researchers are generating data at ever-faster rates because of advances in instrumentation and technology, coupled with decreases in production costs. Unfortunately, the ability of researchers to manage and disseminate their results has not kept pace, so their work cannot achieve its maximal impact. Strides have recently been made, but more awareness is needed of the essential role that biological data resources, including biocuration, play in maintaining and linking this ever-growing flood of data and information. The aim of this paper is to describe the nature of data as an asset, the role biocurators play in increasing its value, and consistent, practical means to measure effectiveness that can guide planning and justify costs in biological research information resources' development and management.},

abstract = {Agricultural extension in sub-Saharan Africa has often been criticised for its focus on linear knowledge transfer, and limited attention to systemic approaches to service delivery. Currently, the region is experiencing a new-ICT revolution and there are high expectations of new-ICTs to enhance interaction and information exchange in extension service delivery. Using an innovation systems perspective, we distinguish the roles demand-articulation, matching demand and supply, and innovation process management for innovation-intermediaries. The study explores literature on how new-ICT may support these roles, with specific interest in the possibilities of environmental monitoring and new forms of organisation enabled by enhanced connectivity. In order to contribute to the understanding of this area, the paper reports on a comparative study of two new-ICT platforms embedded in Ghanaian public and private extension organisations respectively. We assess the roles that these platforms (aim to) support, and document achievements and constraints based on interviews with extension staff and farmers. The findings indicate that while both platforms aim to support innovation-intermediation roles the focus areas and level of detail differ due to diverging organisational rationales to service delivery. In addition, we see that new-ICTs' potential to support innovation-intermediation roles is far from realised. This is not due to (new) ICTs lacking the capacity to link people in new ways and make information accessible, but due to the wider social, organisational and institutional factors that define the realisation of their potential. Therefore, more conventional modes of interaction around production advice and also credit provision continue to be dominant and better adapted to the situation. However, beyond the two platforms that were developed specifically by and for the extension organisations, there were indications that more informal and self-organised new-ICT initiatives can transform and enhance interaction patterns in innovations systems to achieve collective goals through standard virtual platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram.},

abstract = {Spatial predictions of soil macro and micro-nutrient content across Sub-Saharan Africa at 250 m spatial resolution and for 0–30 cm depth interval are presented. Predictions were produced for 15 target nutrients: organic carbon (C) and total (organic) nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), and extractable—phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al) and boron (B). Model training was performed using soil samples from ca. 59,000 locations (a compilation of soil samples from the AfSIS, EthioSIS, One Acre Fund, VitalSigns and legacy soil data) and an extensive stack of remote sensing covariates in addition to landform, lithologic and land cover maps. An ensemble model was then created for each nutrient from two machine learning algorithms—random forest and gradient boosting, as implemented in R packages ranger and xgboost—and then used to generate predictions in a fully-optimized computing system. Cross-validation revealed that apart from S, P and B, significant models can be produced for most targeted nutrients (R-square between 40–85{\%}). Further comparison with OFRA field trial database shows that soil nutrients are indeed critical for agricultural development, with Mn, Zn, Al, B and Na, appearing as the most important nutrients for predicting crop yield. A limiting factor for mapping nutrients using the existing point data in Africa appears to be (1) the high spatial clustering of sampling locations, and (2) missing more detailed parent material/geological maps. Logical steps towards improving prediction accuracies include: further collection of input (training) point samples, further harmonization of measurement methods, addition of more detailed covariates specific to Africa, and implementation of a full spatio-temporal statistical modeling framework.},

The main objectives of the study are to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on land suitability for alfalfa production in Ethiopia and to assess the extent of irrigation requirements for alfalfa growing under the adverse climate change projections. The impact of climate change on land suitability for alfalfa was evaluated using projected changes in rainfall and temperature based on three global circulation models (CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, and MIROC5).

The projected climate alters the suitable land for fodder production across Ethiopia. Expansion of suitable land occurred in the highlands where climate scenarios predict an increase in temperature and precipitation. Dryland regions showed a rainfall deficit for the three model projections. The research provides guidelines for growing alfalfa in Ethiopia considering ecological and climatic variability.},

It examines adoption estimates for PA from completed surveys that utilized random sampling procedures, as well as estimates of adoption using other survey methods, with an objective to document the national or regional level adoption patterns of PA using existing data. The analysis indicates that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) guidance and associated automated technologies like sprayer boom control and planter row or section shutoffs have been adopted as fast as any major agricultural technology in history. The main reason for the perception that PA adoption is slow is because PA is often associated with variable rate technology (VRT)—just one of many PA technologies, one of the first adopted by many farmers, but that now rarely exceeds 20{\%} of farms. This level of adoption suggests that farmers like the idea of VRT, but are not convinced of its value. VRT adoption estimates for niche groups of farmers may exceed 50{\%}. The biggest gap in PA adoption is for medium and small farms in the developing world that do not use motorized mechanization.},

A structured literature review (1995–2014) assessed 350 journal articles about provision of one or more ESs by trees on farms and in agricultural landscapes in SSA. This revealed information on 15 ESs from studies in 23 countries covering arid (1{\%} of studies), semi-arid (49{\%}), sub-humid (26{\%}) and humid (24{\%}) agro-ecological zones. The majority of the studies reported provisioning (39{\%}) and supporting (35{\%}) followed by regulating (26{\%}) ESs while studies on cultural services were scarce. Beneficial impacts of trees were dominating (58{\%}), in particular in semi-arid zones where they were associated with enhancing water and nutrient cycling. A decline in some ESs was reported in 15{\%} of the studies, while 28{\%} found no effect of trees. Although the effects of trees were mainly positive, a decline in crop production was noted as a key trade-off against the provisions of ESs, such as modification of microclimate. This highlights the need to manage trade-offs among impacts of trees on ES provision to reduce competition and increase complementarity between trees and crops.},

We obtained spatial confinement below size of the Bohr radius for proton spin chain FWHM. Precise manipulation of individual spins and polarization of electron spin states are analyzed via proton induced emission and controlled population of energy shells in pure 29Si nanocrystal. Entangled quantum states of channeled proton trajectories are mapped in transverse and angular phase space of 29Si axial channel alignment in order to avoid transversal excitations. Proton density and proton energy as impact parameter functions are characterized in single particle density matrix via discretization of diagonal and nearest off-diagonal elements. We combined high field and low densities (1 MeV/92 nm) to create inseparable quantum state by superimposing the hyperpolarizationed proton spin chain with electron spin of 29Si. Quantum discretization of density of states (DOS) was performed by the Monte Carlo simulation method using numerical solutions of proton equations of motion. Distribution of gaussian coherent states is obtained by continuous modulation of individual spin phase and amplitude. Obtained results allow precise engineering and faithful mapping of spin states. This would provide the effective quantum key distribution (QKD) and transmission of quantum information over remote distances between quantum memory centers for scalable quantum communication network. Furthermore, obtained results give insights in application of channeled protons subatomic microscopy as a complete versatile scanning-probe system capable of both quantum engineering of charged particle states and characterization of quantum states below diffraction limit linear and in-depth resolution.},

Against this backdrop, this study investigated farmers' perceptions and indicators of soil fertility degradation and identified factors that make a difference in the perceptions among farmers in western Kenya. Data for this analysis were collected from a random sample of 331 households in Vihiga and Siaya Districts and analysed by descriptive statistics and ordered logit model. Results showed that 90 per cent of the households perceived that soil fertility was declining using different indicators, especially decreasing crop yields, poor crop growth vigour, presence of indicator weeds and soil colour. The key determinants of farmers' extent of perceptions were farm and farmer characteristics as well as institutional factors. This study recommends the use of farmers' perceptions and knowledge as important entry points for research and dissemination of appropriate soil fertility management practices.

abstract = {Empirical analysis of rural credit market failure has been of key scientific and political interest in recent years. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the various methods for measuring credit rationing that are employed in the literature. Furthermore, the methods are subjected to a comparative evaluation of their specific strengths or shortcomings. Six approaches are distinguished: measurement of loan transaction costs, analysis of qualitative information collected in interviews, analysis of quantitative information collected in interviews using the credit limit concept, analysis of spill-over effects with regard to secondary credit sources, econometric household modeling, and the econometric analysis of dynamic investment decisions. An explicit comparison with a first-best solution is impossible in the first three approaches, since they essentially rely on a subjective assessment of borrowers' access to credit, based on qualitative or quantitative indicators. The fifth and sixth approaches allow a rigorous interpretation in the framework of neoclassical equilibrium theory. The fourth approach takes an intermediate position, since spill-over on segmented loan markets reveals a willingness to pay with regard to the supposedly less expensive but rationed primary source. The approaches are fairly data demanding in general, usually requiring specific data on loan transactions. Even so, most approaches are applicable to cross-sectional household data. With the exception of the first, all methods surveyed might plausibly be used to empirically detect credit rationing.},

Research Series Issue 63: The adoption of improved agricultural technologies - A meta-analysis for Africa
August 2020
Understanding the determinants of improved agricultural technology adoption is an important component of increasing agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholders to reduce poverty and hunger. In this paper, particular attention is given to the identification and promotion of productivity and resilience enhancing agricultural practices.

Although numerous seminal reviews of this literature have been published, most of these were theoretical or conceptual reviews and focus on earlier literature from continents other than Africa, which is the continent facing the biggest productivity challenge now.

The authors synthesize the findings of this literature with a focus on Africa using a meta-data set that brings together the results of 168 recently published papers. They find that most of this literature focuses on agronomic practices and that agroforestry and livestock related studies make up less than one fifth of the total published papers.

Eleven determinants, primarily those related to information access, wealth indicators and tenure security, are found to increase adoption more than chance would dictate in the literature. The findings provide evidence to support recommendations for future policy and research.},

abstract = {In this paper, a formal test of intra-household commitment is derived and performed. To that end, two models of household intertemporal behaviour are developed. In both models, household members are characterized by individual preferences. In the first formulation, household decisions are always on the ex ante Pareto frontier. In the second model, the assumption of intra-household commitment required by ex ante efficiency is relaxed. It is shown that the full-efficiency household Euler equations are nested in the no-commitment Euler equations. Using this result, the hypothesis that household members can commit to future allocations of resources is tested using the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I strongly reject this hypothesis. It is also shown that the standard unitary framework is a special case of the full-efficiency model. However, if household members are not able to commit, household intertemporal behaviour cannot be characterized using the standard life-cycle model. These findings have two main implications. First, policy makers can change household behaviour by modifying the decision power of individual household members. Second, to evaluate programmes designed to improve the welfare of household members, it would be beneficial to replace the standard unitary model with a characterization of household behaviour that allows for lack of commitment. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

Current approaches to geographic information dissemination to smallholders, such as the rural extension model, are limited, yet advancements in internet and communication technologies (ICTs) could help augment these processes through the provision of agricultural geographic information (AGI) directly to farmers. We analysed recent ICT initiatives for communicating climate and agriculture-related information to smallholders for improved livelihoods and climate change adaptation. Through the critical analysis of initiatives, we identified opportunities for the success of future AGI developments. We systematically examined 27 AGI initiatives reported in academic and grey literature (e.g., organisational databases). Important factors identified for the success of initiatives include affordability, language(s), community partnerships, user collaboration, high quality and locally-relevant information through low-tech platforms, organisational trust, clear business models, and adaptability. We propose initiatives should be better-targeted to deliver AGI to regions in most need of climate adaptation assistance, including SE Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Further assessment of the most effective technological approaches is needed. Initiatives should be independently assessed for evaluation of their uptake and success, and local communities should be better-incorporated into the development of AGI initiatives.},

This problem is particularly acute in Africa where an estimated one in four people still lack adequate food to sustain an active and healthy life. In this study, we consider the potential impact of future population growth and climate change on food security in Africa, looking ahead to 2050. A modelling framework termed FEEDME (Food Estimation and Export for Diet and Malnutrition Evaluation) was used which was characterized to model the impacts of future climate changes (utilizing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios projections) and projected population growth on food availability and subsequent undernourishment prevalence in 44 African countries. Our results indicate that projected rapid population growth will be the leading cause of food insecurity and widespread undernourishment across Africa. Very little to no difference in undernourishment projections were found when we examined future scenarios with and without the effects of climate change, suggesting population growth is the dominant driver of change. Various adaptation options are discussed, such as closing the yield gap via sustainable intensification and increasing imports through trade and aid agreements. These strategies are likely to be critical in preventing catastrophic future food insecurity.},

Whereas the total number of registered maize seed companies in major maize producing countries increased four-fold between 1997 and 2007, the quantity of seed marketed barely doubled suggesting that the seed production and deployment environment is less than perfect.A study involving over 92{\%} of all seed providers in east and southern Africa in 2007 showed that a number bottlenecks affect the entire maize seed value chain. The lack of access to credit constitutes a significant barrier to entry. Until governments and development partners make credit available to seed entrepreneurs directly or through risk sharing arrangements with commercial banks, national seed companies will not grow leaving the seed sector monopolized by the regional and multinational seed companies. In addition, the transfer of genetic materials between public and private sectors should be improved to allow easy access by seed companies to suitable and adapted varieties. To allow for rapid regional spillovers of varieties released in one country to similar agro-ecologies in different countries, the implementation of the harmonized regional seed laws and regulations should be expedited. Finally, the best strategies that increase the adoption of improved maize varieties should be explored and implemented to enhance seed demand. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Exploring the maximum grain yields (GYs) and GY gaps in maize (Zea mays L.) can be beneficial for farmer to identify the GY-limiting factors and take adaptive management practices for a higher GY. The objective of this work was to identify the optimum maize plant density range and the ways to narrow maize GY gaps based on the variation of the GYs, dry matter (DM) accumulation and remobilization with changes in plant density. Field experiments were performed at the 71 Group and Qitai Farm in Xinjiang, China. Two modern cultivars, ZhengDan958 and ZhongDan909, were planted at 12 densities, ranging from 1.5 to 18 plants m–2. With increased plant density, single plant DM decreased exponentially, whereas population-level DM at the pre(DMBS) and post- (DMAS) silking stages increased, and the amount of DM remobilization (ARDM) increased exponentially. Further analysis showed that plants were divided four density ranges: range I ({\textless}6.97 plants m–2), in which no DM remobilization occurred, DMBS and DMAS correlated significantly with GY; range II (6.97–9.54 plants m–2), in which the correlations of DMBS, DMAS, and ARDM with GY were significant; range III (9.54–10.67 plants m–2), in which GY and DMAS were not affected by density, DMBS increased significantly, and only the correlation of DMAS with GY was significant; and range IV ({\textgreater}10.67 plants m–2), in which the correlations of DMBS and ARDM with GY decreased significantly, while that of DMAS increased significantly. Therefore, ranges I and II were considered to be DM-dependent ranges, and a higher GY could be obtained by increasing the population-level DMAS, DMAS, and ARDM. Range III was considered the GY-stable range, increasing population-level DMBS, as well as preventing the loss of harvest index were the best way to enhance maize production. Range IV was interpreted as the GY-loss range, and a higher GY could be obtained by preventing the loss of HI and population-level DMAS.},

abstract = {Meeting food security requirements in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will require increasing fertilizer use to improve crop yields, however excess fertilization can cause environmental and public health problems in surface and groundwater. Determining the threshold of reasonable fertilizer application in SSA requires an understanding of flow dynamics and nutrient transport in under-studied, tropical soils experiencing seasonal rainfall. We estimated leaching flux in Yala, Kenya on a maize field that received from 0 to 200 kg ha−1 of nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Soil pore water concentration measurements during two growing seasons were coupled with results from a numerical fluid flow model to calculate the daily flux of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3−-N). Modeled NO3−-N losses to below 200 cm for 1 year ranged from 40 kg N ha−1 year−1 in the 75 kg N ha−1 year−1 treatment to 81 kg N ha−1 year−1 in the 200 kg N ha−1 treatment. The highest soil pore water NO3−-N concentrations and NO3−-N leaching fluxes occurred on the highest N application plots, however there was a poor correlation between N application rate and NO3−-N leaching for the remaining N application rates. The drought in the second study year resulted in higher pore water NO3−-N concentrations, while NO3−-N leaching was disproportionately smaller than the decrease in precipitation. The lack of a strong correlation between NO3−-N leaching and N application rate, and a large decrease in flux between 120 and 200 cm suggest processes that influence NO3−-N retention in soils below 200 cm will ultimately control NO3−-N leaching at the watershed scale.},

abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

AoB PLANTS 7: plv128; doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv128 Abstract. Recent experimental observations show that gap colonization in small-stature (e.g. grassland and dwarf shrubs) vegetation strongly depends on the abiotic conditions within them. At the same time, within-gap variation in biotic interactions such as competition and facilitation, caused by distance to the gap edge, would affect colonizer performance, but a theoretical framework to explore such patterns is missing. Here, we model how competition, facili-tation and environmental conditions together determine the small-scale patterns of gap colonization along a cold gradient in mountains, by simulating colonizer survival in gaps of various sizes. Our model adds another dimension to the known effects of biotic interactions along a stress gradient by focussing on the trade-off between competition and facilitation in the within-gap environment. We show that this trade-off defines a peak in colonizer survival at a specific distance from the gap edge, which progressively shifts closer to the edge as the environment gets colder, ultimately leaving a large fraction of gaps unsuitable for colonization in facilitation-dominated systems. This is reinforced when vegetation size and temperature amelioration are manipulated simultaneously with temperature in order to simulate an elevational gradient more realistically. Interestingly, all other conditions being equal, the magnitude of the realized survival peak was always lower in large than in small gaps, making large gaps harder to colonize. The model is relevant to predict effects of non-native plant invasions and climate warming on colonization processes in mountains.},

abstract = {Sustainable agriculture and agro-ecology justify the need to study and understand the role played by ecological processes, and soil biodiversity in particular, in agro-ecosystem functioning. A large number of studies have focused on earthworms in temperate and humid tropical ecosystems and have demonstrated their importance for improving soil biological, physical, and chemical properties in agro-ecosystems. Their “success” is so essential that earthworms are widely considered key species and relevant indicators of soil health in temperate ecosystems. In arid and sub-arid ecosystems, the role of “soil engineer” is usually attributed to termites, and especially fungus-growing termites in Africa and Asia. However, despite this recognition, significant effort is spent eradicating them in plantations because of their pest status. In this review, we discuss the status of termites (“pests” vs. “soil engineers”) and question whether termites play similar roles to earthworms in arid- and sub-arid agroecosystems, with a focus on their influence on nutrient cycling and water dynamics. We argue that the dream of controlling natural interactions and ridding plantations of termites remains a costly legacy of the green revolution. We review the agricultural practices that have been used to reduce termite damage in plantations by restoring refuges to predators or by reorienting termite foraging activity towards organic amendments. Then, we show that the stimulation of termite activity can be used to improve key ecological functions in agro-ecosystems, such as increasing water availability to plants or producing fertility hot-spots. Finally, we suggest that more research on how termites can be used for improving ecosystem services, as is actually done with earthworms in temperate and humid tropical countries, could lead to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the impact of termites in tropical agro-ecosytems.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Creating typologies is a way to summarize the large heterogeneity of smallholder farming systems into a few farm types. Various methods exist, commonly using statistical analysis, to create these typologies. We demonstrate that the methodological decisions on data collection, variable selection, data-reduction and clustering techniques can bear a large impact on the typology results. We illustrate the effects of analysing the diversity from different angles, using different typology objectives and different hypotheses, on typology creation by using an example from Zambia's Eastern Province. Five separate typologies were created with principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), based on three different expert-informed hypotheses. The greatest overlap between typologies was observed for the larger, wealthier farm types but for the remainder of the farms there were no clear overlaps between typologies. Based on these results, we argue that the typology development should be guided by a hypothesis on the local agriculture features and the drivers and mechanisms of differentiation among farming systems, such as biophysical and socio-economic conditions. That hypothesis is based both on the typology objective and on prior expert knowledge and theories of the farm diversity in the study area. We present a methodological framework that aims to integrate participatory and statistical methods for hypothesis-based typology construction. This is an iterative process whereby the results of the statistical analysis are compared with the reality of the target population as hypothesized by the local experts. Using a well-defined hypothesis and the presented methodological framework, which consolidates the hypothesis through local expert knowledge for the creation of typologies, warrants development of less subjective and more contextualized quantitative farm typologies.},

In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices.

We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods.

In this study, therefore, crop losses due to FAW in 2017 and 2018 were estimated in all the maize production areas of Kenya. Data were collected during June and July 2018 through 121 group discussions with 1439 farmers, separately with men (697) and women (742), in communities that were randomly selected to represent the major maize growing areas. The results showed that most participants (82{\%}) could correctly identify the FAW from pictures. By 2016, FAW was observed by more than half of the communities (53{\%}), with most of the other half first observing FAW in 2017. The proportion of farmers affected by FAW substantially increased, from the long rains of 2017 (63{\%}) to the long rains of 2018 (83{\%}), and in all zones except for the high tropics and moist mid-altitudes. However, the percentage of loss experienced by affected farmers decreased slightly, from 54{\%} in 2017 to 42{\%} in 2018. In 2017, the low- and medium-potential maize-production areas were the most affected, with losses of {\textgreater}50{\%}, with high-potential areas facing losses of about 30{\%}, resulting in a total loss of 37{\%} for the whole country. In the main 2018 season, losses in the low- and medium-potential areas were less – about 20{\%}, but the high-potential areas were now more affected, leading to a total estimate of 33{\%}. We conclude that FAW has suddenly become a major pest in Kenya, causing losses of about a third of the annual maize production, estimated at about 1 million tonnes.},

abstract = {Background: Rural livelihoods relying on agriculture are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Climate models project increasingly negative effects on maize and sorghum production in sub-Saharan Africa. We present a case study of the role of genetic resources and seed systems in adapting to climatic stress from the semi-arid agroecological zone in Tanzania. Results: Crop adaptation, switching to more drought-tolerant crop species or varieties, is an important adaptation strategy within a diverse portfolio of livelihood responses to climatic stress. Crop adaptation involves the adoption of improved maize varieties combined with continued use of local varieties of both maize and sorghum. Regression modelling shows that households receiving the extension service and owning livestock are more likely to switch to drought-tolerant varieties as a response to climatic stress than those without access to these assets. The seed system in the study area consists of both formal and informal elements. The informal channels supply the highest quantities of both sorghum and maize seeds. Recycling of improved varieties of maize is common and the majority of households practice seed selection. Detailed assessment of the three different categories of genetic resources - local, improved and farmer-recycled varieties - reveals that drought tolerance is more frequently reported as a reason for growing local varieties than for growing improved varieties of maize and sorghum. The significantly later maturity reported for local varieties compared to the improved varieties bred to have a short growing cycle indicates that households distinguish between drought-tolerance and drought-avoidance traits. Conclusions: Seed system perspectives on crop adaptation offer insights into the complex ways crop adaptation is realized at the livelihood level. The integration of informal and formal seed system elements is important for the adaptive capacity of agriculture-based livelihoods. Our findings highlight the value and importance of location-specific information about crop variety use for arriving at realistic recommendations in impact and adaptation studies.},

abstract = {The need to promote fertiliser use by African smallholder farmers to counteract the current decline in per capita food production is widely recognised. But soil heterogeneity results in variable responses of crops to fertilisers within single farms. We used existing databases on maize production under farmer (F-M) and researcher management (R-M) to analyse the effect of soil heterogeneity on the different components of nutrient use efficiency by maize growing on smallholder farms in western Kenya: nutrient availability, capture and conversion efficiencies and crop biomass partitioning. Subsequently, we used the simple model QUEFTS to calculate nutrient recovery efficiencies from the R-M plots and to calculate attainable yields with and without fertilisers based on measured soil properties across heterogeneous farms. The yield gap of maize between F-M and R-M varied from 0.5 to 3 t grain ha-1 season -1 across field types and localities. Poor fields under R-M yielded better than F-M, even without fertilisers. Such differences, of up to 1.1 t ha-1 greater yields under R-M conditions are attributable to improved agronomic management and germplasm. The relative response of maize to N-P-K fertilisers tended to decrease with increasing soil quality (soil C and extractable P), from a maximum of 4.4-fold to -0.5-fold relative to the control. Soil heterogeneity affected resource use efficiencies mainly through effects on the efficiency of resource capture. Apparent recovery efficiencies varied between 0 and 70{\%} for N, 0 and 15{\%} for P, and 0 to 52{\%} for K. Resource conversion efficiencies were less variable across fields and localities, with average values of 97 kg DM kg-1 N, 558 kg DM kg-1 P and 111 kg DM kg-1 K taken up. Using measured soil chemical properties QUEFTS over-estimated observed yields under F-M, indicating that variable crop performance within and across farms cannot be ascribed solely to soil nutrient availability. For the R-M plots QUEFTS predicted positive crop responses to application of 30 kg P ha-1 and 30 kg P ha-1 + 90 kg N ha-1 for a wide range of soil qualities, indicating that there is room to improve current crop productivity through fertiliser use. To ensure their efficient use in sub-Saharan Africa mineral fertilisers should be: (1) targeted to specific niches of soil fertility within heterogeneous farms; and (2) go hand-in-hand with the implementation of agronomic measures to improve their capture and utilisation. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

A set of 39 multi-year MODIS metrics incorporating four MODIS land bands, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and thermal data was employed to depict cropland phenology over the study period. Sub-pixel training datasets were used to generate a set of global classification tree models using a bagging methodology, resulting in a global per-pixel cropland probability layer. This product was subsequently thresholded to create a discrete cropland/non-cropland indicator map using data from the USDA-FAS (Foreign Agricultural Service) Production, Supply and Distribution (PSD) database describing per-country acreage of production field crops. Five global land cover products, four of which attempted to map croplands in the context of multiclass land cover classifications, were subsequently used to perform regional evaluations of the global MODIS cropland extent map. The global probability layer was further examined with reference to four principle global food crops: corn, soybeans, wheat and rice. Overall results indicate that the MODIS layer best depicts regions of intensive broadleaf crop production (corn and soybean), both in correspondence with existing maps and in associated high probability matching thresholds. Probability thresholds for wheat-growing regions were lower, while areas of rice production had the lowest associated confidence. Regions absent of agricultural intensification, such as Africa, are poorly characterized regardless of crop type. The results reflect the value of MODIS as a generic global cropland indicator for intensive agriculture production regions, but with little sensitivity in areas of low agricultural intensification. Variability in mapping accuracies between areas dominated by different crop types also points to the desirability of a crop-specific approach rather than attempting to map croplands in aggregate. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the authors.},

This expectation that more farmers should be using inorganic fertiliser, and at higher rates, implies it is profitable to use rates higher than observed if farmers are rational expected profit maximisers. We obtain consistent estimates of the effects of applied nitrogen on rice production. We find the yield response to applied nitrogen to be low in the main rice growing farming system. Farmer behaviour is not inconsistent with expected profitability which is limited by a low yield response to applied fertiliser, high transportation costs, and low selling prices for rice in rural areas. In particular, we do not find any farmers for whom applied nitrogen is profitable that are not using fertiliser in the study sample for each of our survey years (2010 and 2012).},

was more effective than the organic system in both years. Safflower was
the superior competitor when grown with bitter vetch, and its

While the potentials of mobile services to provide development opportunities for smallholder farmers are widely acknowledged, the potentials to use smartphone applications to collect data on smallholder farming systems are little explored. Yet, researchers studying farming systems need good quality data. So far, data on smallholder farming systems is typically collected using household surveys. Survey questions are prone to recall biases, however, which can be substantial. This paper assesses whether smartphone can be used to collect data in real time and thus increase the accuracy of socioeconomic and agronomic data collection. In this paper, we present a smartphone application that was developed for this purpose. We use the application to analyze the effects of agricultural mechanization on intra-household time-use and nutrition in rural Zambia. While the early, descriptive results shed interesting light on the effects of mechanization, the contribution of this study is primarily methodological. The study highlights the potentials of using smartphone applications to collect socioeconomic and agronomic data on smallholder-farming systems, potentially in real time. It also suggests ways to combine data recorded by respondents with built-in sensors of smartphones and external sensors and thus shows fascinating new pathways for researchers in the digital age.},

A rapidly changing world necessitates sustainability principles be developed to reinvent these technologies and test them at scale. The need is particularly urgent in Africa, where ecosystems are degrading and crop yields have stagnated. An unprecedented opportunity to reverse this trend is unfolding in Malawi, where a 90{\%} subsidy has ensured access to fertilization and improved maize seed, with substantive gains in productivity for millions of farmers. To test if economic and ecological sustainability could be improved, we preformed manipulative experimentation with crop diversity in a countrywide trial (n = 991) and at adaptive, local scales through a decade of participatory research (n = 146). Spatial and temporal treatments compared monoculture maize with legume-diversified maize that included annual and semiperennial (SP) growth habits in temporal and spatial combinations, including rotation, SP rotation, intercrop, and SP intercrop systems. Modest fertilizer intensification doubled grain yield compared with monoculture maize. Biodiversity improved ecosystem function further: SP rotation systems at half-fertilizer rates produced equivalent quantities of grain, on a more stable basis (yield variability reduced from 22{\%} to 13{\%}) compared with monoculture. Across sites, profitability and farmer preference matched: SP rotations provided twofold superior returns, whereas diversification of maize with annual legumes provided more modest returns. In this study, we provide evidence that in Africa, crop diversification can be effective at a countrywide scale, and that shrubby, grain legumes can enhance environmental and food security.},

Research Series Issue 63: The adoption of improved agricultural technologies - A meta-analysis for Africa
August 2020
Understanding the determinants of improved agricultural technology adoption is an important component of increasing agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholders to reduce poverty and hunger. In this paper, particular attention is given to the identification and promotion of productivity and resilience enhancing agricultural practices.

Although numerous seminal reviews of this literature have been published, most of these were theoretical or conceptual reviews and focus on earlier literature from continents other than Africa, which is the continent facing the biggest productivity challenge now.

The authors synthesize the findings of this literature with a focus on Africa using a meta-data set that brings together the results of 168 recently published papers. They find that most of this literature focuses on agronomic practices and that agroforestry and livestock related studies make up less than one fifth of the total published papers.

Eleven determinants, primarily those related to information access, wealth indicators and tenure security, are found to increase adoption more than chance would dictate in the literature. The findings provide evidence to support recommendations for future policy and research.},

Short-term-oriented activities such as fertilizer application help to cover immediate food needs but compromise on future food production. Long-term-oriented production activities such as building up soil fertility are important systemic leverage points; however, they compromise on today's harvests. This article uses a semicomputerized observational experiment in Zambia to investigate farm management decision making with conflicting production objectives in a dynamic context. The results reveal that, overall, Zambian smallholder farmers have a strong and significant preference for short-term-oriented production activities, which leads to a suboptimal performance in production in the long term. A mind shift towards more long-term-oriented production activities is required to sustainably increase food production. Our findings point at two things in this regard: First, we identify decision rules that successful performers have applied and that should be the basis for capacity building strategies. Second, we indicate that our approach itself contributed to recognition of the importance of a longer term perspective.},

abstract = {Rural advisory services (RAS) have the potential to play critical roles in improving the livelihoods and well-being of rural people worldwide, and to enable rural people to maximise their contributions to sustainable national, regional, and global development. Given this potential, RAS are often tasked with a diversity of activities that go well beyond transferring to farmers new technologies that focus on improving production and agricultural productivity. Providers of RAS may now be required to play other roles: for example, to link farmers to local and international markets; to strengthen value chains and support farmers in entrepreneurial ventures; to provide advice on options for managing their farms; to propose actions that reduce the vulnerability of the rural poor, especially smallholders, women, and youth; to promote the inclusion of youth in agriculture; to promote nutrition and gender in households; to support farmers' bargaining position and help them organise themselves in groups and cooperatives; to ensure environmental conservation; to bridge the rural–urban divide and contribute to sustainable rural and urban transformation; to enhance and strengthen innovation processes by brokering and facilitating cooperation between different actors in the agricultural innovation system – and more. To fulfil these tasks, a wide range of approaches, methods, and principles exist, which all have their advantages and disadvantages, costs, challenges, and opportunities. The success or failure of these approaches is always closely linked to the context in which they are applied, so it is critical to strengthen the capacities of RAS providers to select and adapt approaches to a specific context and to the needs of the stakeholders involved in agriculture in that context. Extensive documentation, knowledge, and information is available on these approaches and principles in a wide range of publications.

abstract = {This paper explores the impacts of hybrid maize adoption on the welfare of farming households in Kenya. We use a four-year panel dataset to estimate the effects of hybrid seed use on four indicators of household welfare, namely, income, assets, inequality and poverty. Results show that use of hybrid seed not only contributes to higher annual income, but also to raising the value of assets, possibly reflecting longer-term welfare effects. Further, we find that use of hybrid seed reduces the depth of poverty, and that the amount planted reduces inequality. As expected, impacts differ between major and minor maize-growing areas of the country. Maize farmers who do not use hybrid seed are clearly disadvantaged. This calls for continued public and private investments in the infrastructure and policy process that supports a competitive, liberalized seed industry and improved access of smallholder farmers to well-adapted, affordable hybrids. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

abstract = {Technological interventions to address the problem of poor productivity of smallholder agricultural systems must be designed to target socially diverse and spatially heterogeneous farms and farming systems. This paper proposes a categorisation of household diversity based on a functional typology of livelihood strategies, and analyses the influence of such diversity on current soil fertility status and spatial variability on a sample of 250 randomly selected farms from six districts of Kenya and Uganda. In spite of the agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity observed across the region (e.g. 4 months year-1 of food self-sufficiency in Vihiga, Kenya vs. 10 in Tororo, Uganda) consistent patterns of variability were also observed. For example, all the households with less than 3 months year-1 of food self-sufficiency had a land:labour ratio (LLR) {\textless} 1, and all those with LLR {\textgreater} 1 produced enough food to cover their diet for at least 5 months. Households with LLR {\textless} 1 were also those who generated more than 50{\%} of their total income outside the farm. Dependence on off/non-farm income was one of the main factors associated with household diversity. Based on indicators of resource endowment and income strategies and using principal component analysis, farmers' rankings and cluster analysis the 250 households surveyed were grouped into five farm types: (1) Farms that rely mainly on permanent off-farm employment (from 10 to 28{\%} of the farmers interviewed, according to site); (2) larger, wealthier farms growing cash crops (8-20{\%}); (3) medium resource endowment, food self-sufficient farms (20-38{\%}); (4) medium to low resource endowment relying partly on non-farm activities (18-30{\%}); and (5) poor households with family members employed locally as agricultural labourers by wealthier farmers (13-25{\%}). Due to differential soil management over long periods of time, and to ample diversity in resource endowments (land, livestock, labour) and access to cash, the five farm types exhibited different soil carbon and nutrient stocks (e.g. Type 2 farms had average C, N, P and K stocks that were 2-3 times larger than for Types 4 or 5). In general, soil spatial variability was larger in farms (and sites) with poorer soils and smaller in farms owning livestock. The five farm types identified may be seen as domains to target technological innovations and/or development efforts. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Agricultural intensification has resulted in a simplification of agricultural landscapes by the expansion of agricultural land, enlargement of field size and removal of non-crop habitat. These changes are considered to be an important cause of the rapid decline in farmland biodiversity, with the remaining biodiversity concentrated in field edges and non-crop habitats. The simplification of landscape composition and the decline of biodiversity may affect the functioning of natural pest control because non-crop habitats provide requisites for a broad spectrum of natural enemies, and the exchange of natural enemies between crop and non-crop habitats is likely to be diminished in landscapes dominated by arable cropland. In this review, we test the hypothesis that natural pest control is enhanced in complex patchy landscapes with a high proportion of non-crop habitats as compared to simple large-scale landscapes with little associated non-crop habitat. In 74{\%} and 45{\%} of the studies reviewed, respectively, natural enemy populations were higher and pest pressure lower in complex landscapes versus simple landscapes. Landscape-driven pest suppression may result in lower crop injury, although this has rarely been documented. Enhanced natural enemy activity was associated with herbaceous habitats in 80{\%} of the cases (e.g. fallows, field margins), and somewhat less often with wooded habitats (71{\%}) and landscape patchiness (70{\%}). The similar contributions of these landscape factors suggest that all are equally important in enhancing natural enemy populations. We conclude that diversified landscapes hold most potential for the conservation of biodiversity and sustaining the pest control function. {\textcopyright}2006 The Royal Society.},

Several challenges to effectively scaling up the use of ICTs for development remain, however. Taking advantage of the opportunities provided by ICTs depends on increased connectivity of marginalized population groups, the content and usefulness of the information provided through ICTs, and the capacity of households in rural areas to understand and act on the information that they receive.

abstract = {Crops that grow on soils with higher fertility often have higher yields and higher tissue nutrient concentrations. Whether this is the case for all crops, and which soil and management factors, or combinations mostly affect yields and food nutrient concentrations however, is poorly understood. Here, the main aim was to evaluate effects of soil and management factors on crop yields and food nutrient concentrations in (i) grain, fruit and tuber crops, and (ii) between high and low soil fertility areas. Total elemental concentrations of Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu were measured using a portable X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (pXRF) in maize grain (Zea mays; Teso South, Kenya: n = 31; Kapchorwa, Uganda n = 30), cassava tuber (Manihot esculenta; Teso South: n = 27), and matooke fruit (Musa acuminata; Kapchorwa, n = 54). Soil properties measured were eCEC, total N and C, pH, texture, and total elemental content. Farm management variables (fertilisation, distance to household, and crop diversity) were collected. Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA) with permutation rank tests identified driving factors of alterations in nutrient concentrations. Maize grain had higher correlations with soil factors (CCA {\textgreater} 80{\%}), than cassava tuber (76{\%}) or matooke fruit (39{\%}). In contrast, corresponding correlations to management factors were much lower (8–39{\%}). The main soil properties affecting food nutrients were organic matter and texture. Surprisingly, pH did not play an important role. A positive association of crop diversity with nutrient concentration and yield in lower fertility areas was observed. Considering, food nutrient composition, apart from yield, as response variables in agronomic trials (e.g. fertilisation or soil improvement strategies), would contribute towards discounting the notion that crops growing on fertile soils always produce healthy and high quality foods.},

Experts disagree on the status of these very similar taxa, as taste remains the only character by which they can be distinguished in the field. We combined occurrences and environment data in ecological niche models to assess suitable areas for the two species. Irvingia gabonensis presented a wider occurrence area due to cultivation across contrasting ecological areas. Irvingia wombolu does not appear to be cultivated and only occurred in southwestern Togo. These differences in range is likely determined by phenological limitations of I. wombolu, reinforced by differences in local management systems, thus confirming the failure of market development to impact useful plant species' conservation significantly. Highly suitable areas for I. wombolu were in the Volta Forest, where I. gabonensis saw low suitability, while out of this inverse situation was observed, as regard environmental suitability. These differences are significant, implying different ecological adaptation. However, anthropogenic influences, related to domestication history, are also important. Therefore, updated genetic investigations and field trials in contrasting ecological areas are required for understanding the origin of differences between these two forms.},

Fertilizer application led to an 88{\%} increase in yield, 54{\%} increase in number of seeds per cob, and 14{\%} increase in 100-seed weight. Fertilizer application also led to an increase in seed vigour and viability. Yield differences between the 2 varieties were not significant. The correlation between 100-seed weight and seed vigour was significant showing that heavy seeds were more vigourous. Nitrogen application was therefore recommended for increasing yields and for producing vigourous seeds but should be done with caution to avoid lodging as witnessed.

abstract = {Grain legumes play a key role in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in relation to food and nutrition security and income generation. Moreover, because of their N2-fixation capacity, such legumes can also have a positive influence on soil fertility. Notwithstanding many decades of research on the agronomy of grain legumes, their N2-fixation capacity, and their contribution to overall system productivity, several issues remain to be resolved to realize fully the benefits of grain legumes. In this paper we highlight major lessons learnt and expose key knowledge gaps in relation to grain legumes and their contributions to farming system productivity. The symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia forms the basis for its benefits and biological N2-fixation (BNF) relies as much on the legume genotype as on the rhizobial strains. As such, breeding grain legumes for BNF deserves considerably more attention. Even promiscuous varieties usually respond to inoculation, and as African soils contain a huge pool of unexploited biodiversity with potential to contribute elite rhizobial strains, strain selection should go hand-in-hand with legume breeding for N2-fixation. Although inoculated strains can outcompete indigenous strains, our understanding of what constitutes a good competitor is rudimentary, as well as which factors affect the persistence of inoculated rhizobia, which in its turn determines whether a farmer needs to re-inoculate each and every season. Although it is commonly assumed that indigenous rhizobia are better adapted to local conditions than elite strains used in inoculants, there is little evidence that this is the case. The problems of delivering inoculants to smallholders through poorly-developed supply chains in Africa necessitates inoculants based on sterile carriers with long shelf life. Other factors critical for a well-functioning symbiosis are also central to the overall productivity of grain legumes. Good agronomic practices, including the use of phosphorus (P)-containing fertilizer, improve legume yields though responses to inputs are usually very variable. In some situations, a considerable proportion of soils show no response of legumes to applied inputs, often referred to as non-responsive soils. Understanding the causes underlying this phenomenon is limited and hinders the uptake of legume agronomy practices. Grain legumes also contribute to the productivity of farming systems, although such effects are commonly greater in rotational than in intercropping systems. While most cropping systems allow for the integration of legumes, intercropped legumes provide only marginal benefits to associated crops. Important rotational benefits have been shown for most grain legumes though those with the highest N accumulation and lowest N harvest index appear to demonstrate higher residual benefits. N balance estimates often results in contradictory observations, mostly caused by the lack of understanding of belowground contributions of legumes to the N balance. Lastly, the ultimate condition for increased uptake of grain legumes by smallholder farmers lies in the understanding of how legume technologies and management practices can be tailored to the enormous diversity of agroecologies, farming systems, and smallholder farms in SSA. In conclusion, while research on grain legumes has revealed a number of important insights that will guide realization of the full potential of such legumes to the sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in SSA, many research challenges remain to be addressed to realize the full potential of BNF in these systems.},

abstract = {Typologies may be used as tools for dealing with farming system heterogeneity. This is achieved by classifying farms into groups that have common characteristics, i.e. farm types, which can support the implementation of a more tailored approach to agricultural development. This article explored patterns of farming system diversity through the classification of 70 smallholder farm households in two districts (Savelugu-Nanton and Tolon-Kumbungu) of Ghana's Northern Region. Based on 2013 survey data, the typology was constructed using the multivariate statistical techniques of principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Results proposed six farm types, stratified on the basis of household, labour, land use, livestock and income variables, explaining the structural and functional differences between farming systems. Types 1 and 2 were characterized by relatively high levels of resource endowment and oriented towards non-farm activities and crop sales respectively. Types 3 and 4 were moderately resource-endowed with income derived primarily from on-farm activities. Types 5 and 6 were resource constrained, with production oriented towards subsistence. The most salient differences among farm types concerned herd size (largest for Type 1), degree of legume integration (largest for Types 2–4), household size and hired labour (smallest household size for Types 4 and 6, and largest proportion of hired labour for Type 4), degree of diversification into off/non-farm activities (highest for Type 1 and lowest for Type 5) and severity of resource constraints (Type 6 was most constrained with a small farm area and herd comprised mainly of poultry). It was found that livelihood strategies reflected the distinctive characteristics of farm households; with poorly-endowed types restricted to a ‘survival strategy' and more affluent types free to pursue a ‘development strategy'. This study clearly demonstrates that using the established typology as a practical framework allows identification of type-specific farm household opportunities and constraints for the targeting of agricultural interventions and innovations, which will be further analysed in the research-for-development project. We conclude that a more flexible approach to typology construction, for example through the incorporation of farmer perspectives, might provide further context and insight into the causes, consequences and negotiation of farm diversity.},

Research Series Issue 63: The adoption of improved agricultural technologies - A meta-analysis for Africa
August 2020
Understanding the determinants of improved agricultural technology adoption is an important component of increasing agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholders to reduce poverty and hunger. In this paper, particular attention is given to the identification and promotion of productivity and resilience enhancing agricultural practices.

Although numerous seminal reviews of this literature have been published, most of these were theoretical or conceptual reviews and focus on earlier literature from continents other than Africa, which is the continent facing the biggest productivity challenge now.

The authors synthesize the findings of this literature with a focus on Africa using a meta-data set that brings together the results of 168 recently published papers. They find that most of this literature focuses on agronomic practices and that agroforestry and livestock related studies make up less than one fifth of the total published papers.

Eleven determinants, primarily those related to information access, wealth indicators and tenure security, are found to increase adoption more than chance would dictate in the literature. The findings provide evidence to support recommendations for future policy and research.},

abstract = {We investigated the role of labour in explaining the yield gap of cereals at both crop and farm levels on smallholder farms in Southern Ethiopia. A household survey containing detailed information of labour use at crop and farm level of ca. 100 farms in a maize-based system around Hawassa and ca. 100 farms in a wheat-based system around Asella was used for this purpose. Stochastic frontier analysis was combined with the principles of production ecology to decompose maize and wheat yield gaps. Actual maize and wheat yields were on average 1.6 and 2.6 t ha−1, respectively, which correspond to 23 and 26{\%} of the water-limited yield (Yw) of each crop. For both crops, nearly half of the yield gap was attributed to the technology yield gap, indicating sub-optimal crop management to achieve Yw even for the farmers with the highest yields. The efficiency yield gap was ca. 20{\%} of Yw for both crops; it was negatively associated with sowing date and with the proportion of women's labour used for sowing in the case of maize but with the proportion of hired labour used for sowing and weed control in the case of wheat. The resource yield gap was less than 10{\%} of Yw for both crops due to small differences in input use between highest- and lowest-yielding farms. The contribution of capital and farm power availability to crop yields, input use and labour use was analysed at the farm level. Labour calendars showed that crops cultivated in Hawassa were complementary, with peak labour occurring at different times of the year. By contrast, crops cultivated in Asella competed strongly for labour during sowing, hand-weeding and harvesting months, resulting in potential trade-offs at farm level. Oxen ownership was associated with capital availability, but not farm power in Hawassa and with both capital availability and farm power in Asella. Farmers with more oxen applied more nitrogen (N) to maize in Hawassa and cultivated more land in Asella, which is indicative of an intensification pathway in the former and an extensification pathway in the latter. Differences in land:labour ratio and in the types of crops cultivated explained the different strategies used in the two sites. In both sites, although gross margin per unit area increased linearly with increasing crop yield and farm N productivity, gross margin per labour unit increased up to an optimal level of crop yield and farm N productivity after which no further response was observed. This suggests that narrowing the yield gap may not be economically rational in terms of labour productivity. We conclude that labour (and farm power) is not a major determinant of maize yield gaps in Hawassa, but is a major determinant of wheat yield gaps in Asella.},

abstract = {The sustainable intensification of African agriculture is gaining momentum with the compelling need to increase food and agricultural production. In Southern Africa,smallholder farming systems are predominately maize-based and subject to erratic climatic conditions. Farmer crop and soil management decisions are influenced by a plethora of complex factors such as market access resource availability,social relations,environment,and various messages on sustainable farming practices. Such factors pose barriers to increasing sustainable intensification in Africa. This paper characterizes smallholder farming practices in Central Malawi,at Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation (Africa RISING) project sites. We present findings from a survey of 324 farmers,located within four Africa RISING sites selected in a stratified random manner to represent (1) low agricultural potential (high evapotranspiration,variable rainfall),(2) medium agricultural potential (two sites),and (3) high agricultural potential (well-distributed rainfall). Soil fertility was low overall,and certain farming practices appeared to limit the sustainability of agricultural production. Nearly half of farmers did not value legume residues as a high nutrient value resource for soil amelioration,as legume residues were removed (17.9{\%}) or burned (21.4{\%}). Conversely,maize residues were rarely removed (4.5{\%}) or burned (10.4{\%}). We found that farmers do not allocate soil amendment resources to legume fields (zero instances of mineral fertilizer or manure application to legumes compared to 88 and 22{\%} of maize systems,respectively). Policy makers in Malawi have led initiatives to intensify agricultural systems through subsidizing farmer access to mineral fertilizer as well as maize hybrid seed,and only rarely to improved legume seed. In this survey,farmers allocate mineral fertilizer to maize systems and not legume systems. There is urgent need to invest in education on sustainable reinvestment in natural resources through complementary practices,such as maximization of biological nitrogen fixation through improved legume agronomy and better organic resource and crop residue management. Recent efforts by Malawi agricultural services to promote doubled-up legumes as a sustainable intensification technology are encouraging,but benefits will not accrue unless equal attention is given to an extension campaign on management of organic resources such as crop residues.},

Here weconduct a globalmeta-analysis using 5,463 paired yield observations from610 studies to compare no-till, the original and central concept of conservation agriculture, with conventional tillage practices across 48 crops and 63 countries. Overall, our results show that no-till reduces yields, yet this response is variable and under certain conditions no-till can produce equivalent or greater yields than conventional tillage. Importantly,whenno-till is combined with the other two conservation agriculture principles of residue retention and crop rotation, its negative impacts are minimized. Moreover, no-till in combination with the other two principles significantly increases rainfed cropproductivity indry climates, suggesting that itmaybecome animportant climate-change adaptation strategy for ever-drier regions of the world. However, any expansion of conservation agriculture should be done with caution in these areas, as implementation of the other two principles is often challenging in resource-poor and vulnerable smallholder farming systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of yield losses rather than gains. Although farming systems are multifunctional, and environmental and socio-economic factors need to be considered14-16, our analysis indicates that the potential contribution of no-till to the sustainable intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed.},

abstract = {Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in environmental sciences.},

abstract = {Understanding the vulnerability of tree species to anthropogenic threats is important for the efficient planning of restoration and conservation efforts. We quantified and compared the effects of future climate change and four current threats (fire, habitat conversion, overgrazing and overexploitation) on the 50 most common tree species of the tropical dry forests of northwestern Peru and southern Ecuador. We used an ensemble modelling approach to predict species distribution ranges, employed freely accessible spatial datasets to map threat exposures, and developed a trait-based scoring approach to estimate species-specific sensitivities, using differentiated trait weights in accordance with their expected importance in determining species sensitivities to specific threats. Species-specific vulnerability maps were constructed from the product of the exposure maps and the sensitivity estimates. We found that all 50 species face considerable threats, with an average of 46{\%} of species' distribution ranges displaying high or very high vulnerability to at least one of the five threats. Our results suggest that current levels of habitat conversion, overexploitation and overgrazing pose larger threats to most of the studied species than climate change. We present a spatially explicit planning strategy for species-specific restoration and conservation actions, proposing management interventions to focus on (a) in situ conservation of tree populations and seed collection for tree planting activities in areas with low vulnerability to climate change and current threats; (b) ex situ conservation or translocation of populations in areas with high climate change vulnerability; and (c) active planting or assisted regeneration in areas under high current threat vulnerability but low climate change vulnerability, provided that interventions are in place to lower threat pressure. We provide an online, user-friendly tool to visualize both the vulnerability maps and the maps indicating priority restoration and conservation actions.},

abstract = {A study was conducted in Makoni and Hwedza smallholder farming areas in eastern Zimbabwe to investigate local perceptions of the impacts of climate change and variability, and how indigenous knowledge may enable farmers to construct appropriate responses to these impacts and make key agricultural decisions. The study revealed evidence of increased climate variability and heightening vulnerability in farming systems. Rainfall seasons have shortened by up to four weeks, impacting on food sources and ecosystem services, and increasing pressure on women and children as traditional roles change. Communities depended primarily on indigenous knowledge and local biological and geographical indicators of seasonal forecasts in making major strategic, tactical and operational decisions on crop production, including management of food stocks and social safety nets. In providing climate and technical production information, researchers and development practitioners will therefore need to fit in with farmers' local decision-making frameworks. However, it should be recognized that some of the indicators (e.g. biological) on which this indigenous knowledge is traditionally based are also adversely affected by increased climate variability, placing limits on its scope as a basis for decision-making. Despite this, efforts to build the adaptive capacity of these farming communities should still consider the current indigenous knowledge base as an entry point.},

abstract = {The rapid increase of both human and livestock populations, along with a restricted land base and an increased demand for livestock products, put high pressure on the maize-livestock systems that dominate East and Southern Africa. Dual-purpose maize, i.e. varieties with increased grain and stover yields, are therefore being developed. These varieties show high potential, but it is not clear if they respond to a demand by targeted farmers. Therefore the farmers' perspective on such varieties was studied in selected districts in Ethiopia (three districts) and Tanzania (two districts), using both informal methods (participatory rural appraisals) and formal methods (farmer evaluation of varieties and household surveys), the latter involving 360 households in Ethiopia and 150 households in Tanzania. Results show that maize stover is an important element of livestock feed in the study areas. Farmers mention a wide variety of criteria they use to evaluate maize varieties. These include field characteristics such as yield and pest resistance, consumer characteristics such as cooking and taste qualities, and feed characteristics including stover quality and quantity. Analysis of adoption patterns shows that varieties that score well on feed characteristics have a higher probability of being adopted. We conclude that there is a demand for varieties with increased stover quantity and quality, as long as they do not compromise field characteristics, in particular yield, and consumer qualities. Such varieties would have the potential to increase the productivity of maize-livestock systems and the income of these farmers, while reducing the pressure on the environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to identify the various socio-economic variables and how they affect the farmer's decision to adopt soil resource conservation measures in Butere Mumias District. Soil is a fixed national asset which is essential to guarantee food security, cash crop and industrial crop production. It is important to conserve this resource since it cannot be expanded. The study considers the policy framework that needs to be put in place to stimulate the adoption of soil conservation measures. The study area was divided into five clusters and using households as sampling units, forty households were selected per cluster using the simple random sampling technique. A total of 200 respondents were interviewed using structured questionnaires. A Logit model was employed to identify the main factors influencing adoption of soil conservation measures on farms surveyed in this district. The SAS computer package was used to run the model, to derive the maximum likelihood estimates of the adoption process and to calculate the chi-square. The results of the Logit analysis showed that education, age, gender, and land size were significant at 0.05 level of significance. This is an indication that these are critical factors influencing adoption of soil resource conservation measures in the district. Formal education is vital and farmers should be educated on the need to adopt soil conservation measures on their farms. Attention should be focused on the farmers who are over 50 years old who are the main decision makers in most households. The role of extension in promoting individual and corporate soil conservation measures should not be down played especially as concerns providing technical advise. Small-scale farmers should be encouraged to intensify soil conservation as this will improve their soil fertility and improve their yields making their farming profitable},

A survey of 343 smallholder maize farmers was conducted. Most farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya had knowledge about fall armyworm; they could identify it mainly during its larval stage. Furthermore, most farmers in Ethiopia (93{\%}) and Kenya (97{\%}) encountered damage by fall armyworm in their farms. They estimated an average of 32{\%} crop damage in Ethiopia and 47.3{\%} of crop damage in Kenya, with an estimated yield reduction between 0.8 to 1 tonnes/ha. Nearly half of the farmers relied on chemical insecticides to control this pest. The majority (60{\%}) of the farmers in Kenya perceived that insecticides were not effective in controlling fall armyworm as compared to most farmers (46{\%}) in Ethiopia who perceived that chemical spray is effective for the control of fall armyworm. In Ethiopia, 26{\%} of the farmers combined handpicking larvae with insecticide sprays, whilst 15{\%} of the farmers practiced only handpicking. The present study highlights the need to develop management strategies for fall armyworm based on farmers' needs and priorities.},

@article{Giller2006,
abstract = {We discuss the temporal and spatial dynamics of nutrient resources and water within cropping and livestock systems, their interactions and those with other resources such as labour. Short-term dynamics (within season) revolve around nutrient availability and losses as a function of soil moisture dynamics. Longer-term effects (multiple seasons and years) are related to residual effects of crop management in successive seasons and to changes in soil organic matter contents. Spatial patterns of resource use are consistent across different tropical farming systems. Farmers preferentially allocate manure, mineral fertilizers and labour to fields close to the homestead, resulting in strong negative soil fertility gradients away from the homestead. Livestock are the central means of concentration of nutrients within farming systems, resulting in their inequitable redistribution from common lands and poorer households to richer households. Productivity gains achieved by concentration on home plots are at the expense of long-term declining productivity on remote fields. Restricted availability of inputs leads to a form of self-organization resulting in repeating patterns of farm organization that are recognisable across sub-Saharan Africa. Principles for enhancing allocation efficiency of scarce resources are required that address the dynamics of interacting temporal and spatial scales. Managed variability that creates gradients of soil fertility can have major effects on resource use efficiency of both nutrients and water, necessitating analysis of trade-offs at farm scale. Investment decisions of farming families are shaped through complex interactions among competing demands for investment of cash and labour within and beyond farm boundaries. Combinations of socio-economic and agro-ecological conditions can provide windows of opportunity in both time and space that favour investment in particular forms of management. Past research provides a vast array of technologies to improve agricultural production, and understanding of the underlying processes. A research framework is proposed representing farm systems as sets of interacting components. This framework can be used ex-ante, to assist in targeting technologies to specific types of farmers, and for identification of more appropriate technologies. It can be used to explore short and long-term trade-offs of management strategies and to evaluate effects of policy on farms varying in resource endowment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sustainable intensification (SI) is a viable pathway to increase agricultural production and improve ecosystem health. Scaling SI technologies in locations with similar biophysical conditions enhance adoption. This paper employs novel extrapolation detection (ExeDet) algorithm and gridded bioclimatic layers to delineate extrapolation domains for improved maize variety (SC719) and inorganic fertilizers (YaraMila-CEREAL{\textregistered}and YaraBela-Sulfan{\textregistered}) in Tanzania. Suitability was based on grain yields recorded in on-farm trials. The ExeDet algorithm generated three maps: (1) the dissimilarity between bioclimatic conditions in the reference trial sites and the target extrapolation domain (Novelty type-1), (2) the magnitude of novel correlations between covariates in extrapolation domain (Novelty type-2) and (3) the most limiting covariate. The novelty type1 and 2 maps were intersected and reclassified into five suitability classes. These classes were cross-tabulated to generate extrapolation suitability index (ESI) for the candidate technology package. An impact based spatial targeting index (IBSTI) was used to identify areas within the zones earmarked as suitable using ESI where the potential impacts for out scaling interventions can be maximized. Application of ESI and IBSTI is expected to guide extension and development agencies to prioritize scaling intervention based on both biophysical suitability and potential impact of particular technology package. Annual precipitation was most limiting factor in largest area of the extrapolation domain. Identification of the spatial distribution of the limiting factor is useful for recommending remedial measures to address the limiting factor that hinder a technology to achieve its full potential. The method outlined in this paper is replicable to other technologies that require extrapolation provided that representative reference trial data and appropriate biophysical grids are available.},

abstract = {Mechanisms of community assembly and ecosystem function are often analyzed using community-weighted mean trait values (CWMs). We present a novel conceptual framework to quantify the contribution of demographic processes (i.e., growth, recruitment, and mortality) to temporal changes in CWMs. We used this framework to analyze mechanisms of secondary succession in wet tropical forests in Mexico. Seed size increased over time, reflecting a trade-off between colonization by small seeds early in succession, to establishment by large seeds later in succession. Specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf phosphorus content decreased over time, reflecting a trade-off between fast growth early in succession vs. high survival late in succession. On average, CWM shifts were driven mainly (70{\%}) by growth of surviving trees that comprise the bulk of standing biomass, then mortality (25{\%}), and weakly by recruitment (5{\%}). Trait shifts of growing and recruiting trees mirrored the CWM trait shifts, and traits of dying trees did not change during succession, indicating that these traits are important for recruitment and growth, but not for mortality, during the first 30 yr of succession. Identifying the demographic drivers of functional composition change links population dynamics to community change, and enhances insights into mechanisms of succession.},

The maize responded to application of soil amendment materials for the first season with the diammonium phosphate and lime (DAPL) treatment giving the highest maize yields of 6.19 t ha--1 compared to the control which gave 1.36 t ha--1. Soybean yields were low in the first season with the DAPL treatment and control treatment giving yields of 0.32 and 0.14 t ha--1, respectively. This, however, changed significantly after the variety was changed in the second season, with yields going up to 0.68 t ha--1 for the triple superphosphate and lime (TSPL) treatment. From the study, it was concluded that there is potential for growing soybean in Uasin Gishu District of Kenya. However, a study and/or research is recommended to screen and identify a suitable variety for increased soybean yields in this district.},

This study was conducted to ascertain the possibilities of mapping K-deficient soils by the use of existing soil and climatic databases and validate the developed map. Mapping was done in Geographical Information Systems, using moisture data, in the Almanac Characterization Tool. Six study sites were selected: three (Itare, Keumbu, and Ndanai) in the southern geomorphic area (SGA) and three (Ebukanga, Yala, and Kabula) in the northern geomorphic area. Soil samples were analyzed for texture, clay mineralogy, exchangeable K, and other fertility attributes. Maize response to increasing levels of K (0, 25, 50, and 75 kg ha, as KCl) was studied in five of the six sites. Mapped area occupied 13{\%} of the land area in Kenya. Exchangeable K ranged from 0.2 to 1.6 cmol (p) kg and increased significantly with increase in organic C (P = 0.015), pH (P = 0.023), Ca + Mg content (P = 0.031), and K saturation of exchange complex (P = 0.013). Maize response to KCl was not significant in all soils possibly because the three-season testing period was too short, but the probability of response and the profitability of K use in maize increased with seasons in SGA because of increased K depletion. Potassium fertilizer was recommended in soils from the SGA at 25 kg ha. Application of nitrogen-phosphate-K fertilizers was not economical in the northern geomorphic area because of attack by witchweed, Striga hermonthica.

abstract = {There have been numerous efforts to generate freely available climatic datasets for use in species distribution models, the most popular being the global climatic dataset known as WorldClim. The availability of such datasets is invaluable to scientists as many studies are performed in remote areas where no weather stations are found. However, many users do not critically assess the suitability of these datasets for their applications, and errors associated with global datasets are often assumed to be negligible. Understanding what a climate dataset can or cannot deliver requires the user to have a working knowledge of what the basic spatial climate-forcing factors are at the scale of his/her study, and to have a good understanding of the uncertainty in the dataset. In geographic studies, uncertainty is often described by the degree of error (uncertainty), or degree of accuracy (certainty) in data, and thematic uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in measures made for each variable, whereas temporal uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in time period represented by each variable. Here, we used climatic data from weather stations to investigate the climate-forcing factors in southern Kenya, and then used this weather station data to investigate the uncertainty in the WorldClim dataset. Results indicated that the nineteen core Worldclim variables, known as bioclimatic variables, accurately depicted the local variations in climate in the study area. However, whereas the monthly and seasonal temperature variables represented the same time period in different locations, the same was not true for the monthly and seasonal precipitation variables. The onset of rains is a key biological indicator, and scientists studying phenomena tied to the onset of rains need to keep in mind the temporal variations represented in the WorldClim dataset.},

abstract = {Agricultural intensification is key to feed the rapidly increasing African population. While the use of improved varieties has increased substantially over the last twenty years, the use of land-saving technologies such as fertilizer and labor-saving technologies such as mechanization has lagged behind. This study provides a literature review and analyzes the evolution of agricultural mechanization in Kenya, based on four household surveys conducted in Kenya between 1992 and 2012. The results show persistent low levels of agricultural mechanization: in 2012, most farm households still used only hand tools. More than a quarter of farmers (28{\%}) had a plow (either for oxen or tractor), but very few (2{\%}) a tractor. From 1992 to 2012 the percentage of farmers with oxen increased from 17{\%} to 33{\%}, but those with tractors decreased from 5{\%} to 2{\%}. Tractors were most important in the highlands, but animal traction was most important in the dry areas and moist mid-altitude zone. Adoption of tractors increased with income, acreage and age. Adoption of animal traction increased with absentee husbands, income, age, sales of maize, livestock, family size, and access to extension; it decreased with land and with fertilizer use. Mechanization in Kenya is likely to continue depending on animal traction, which is not linked to farm size and complements labor, helps to reduce fertilizer and increase commercial maize production, and has room to grow, in particular in the highlands. Agricultural extension, development projects and research should consider the options in animal traction, and provide training and research on appropriate technologies and implements in areas with sufficient land area.},

abstract = {Manure is a key nutrient resource on smallholder farms in the tropics, especially on poorly buffered sandy soils, due to its multiple benefits for soil fertility. Farmers preferentially apply manure to fields closest to homesteads (homefields), which are more fertile than fields further away (outfields). A three-year experiment was established on homefields and outfields on sandy and clayey soils to assess the effects of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer application in combination with manure or mineral phosphorus (P) on maize yields and soil chemical properties. Significant maize responses to application of N and manure were observed on all fields except the depleted sandy outfield. Large amounts of manure (17 t ha-1 year-1) were required to significantly increase soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, available P, and base saturation, and restore productivity of the depleted sandy outfield. Sole N as ammonium nitrate (100 kg N ha-1) or in combination with single superphosphate led to acidification of the sandy soils, with a decrease of up to 0.8 pH units after three seasons. In a greenhouse experiment, N and calcium (Ca) were identified as deficient in the sandy homefield, while N, P, Ca, and zinc (Zn) were deficient or low on the sandy outfield. The deficiencies of Ca and Zn were alleviated by the addition of manure. This study highlights the essential role of manure in sustaining and replenishing soil fertility on smallholder farms through its multiple effects, although it should be used in combination with N mineral fertilizers due to its low capacity to supply N. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful tool for Bayesian computation. In comparison with the traditional Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, HMC offers greater computational efficiency, especially in higher dimensional or more complex modeling situations. To most statisticians, however, the idea of HMC comes from a less familiar origin, one that is based on the theory of classical mechanics. Its implementation, either through Stan or one of its derivative programs, can appear opaque to beginners. A lack of understanding of the inner working of HMC, in our opinion, has hindered its application to a broader range of statistical problems. In this article, we review the basic concepts of HMC in a language that is more familiar to statisticians, and we describe an HMC implementation in R, one of the most frequently used statistical software environments. We also present hmclearn, an R package for learning HMC. This package contains a general-purpose HMC function for data analysis. We illustrate the use of this package in common statistical models. In doing so, we hope to promote this powerful computational tool for wider use. Example code for common statistical models is presented as supplementary material for online publication.},

abstract = {During participatory prototyping activities in Vihiga, western Kenya, farmers designed what they considered to be the ideal farm [Waithaka, M.M., Thornton, P.K., Herrero, M., Shepherd, K.D., 2006. Bio-economic evaluation of farmers' perceptions of viable farms in western Kenya. Agric. Syst. 90, 243-271]: one in which high productivity is achieved through optimising crop-livestock interactions. We selected four case study crop-livestock farms of different resource endowment (Type 1-4 - excluding the poorest farmers, Type 5, who do not own livestock) and quantified all relevant physical flows through and within them. With this information we parameterised a dynamic, farm-scale simulation model to investigate (i) current differences in resource use efficiencies and degree of crop-livestock interactions across farm types; and (ii) the impact of different interventions in farm Types 3 and 4 on producing the desired shifts in productivity towards the ideal farm. Assuming no resource constraints, changes in the current farm systems were introduced stepwise, as both intensification of external input use (fertilisers and fodder) and qualitative changes in the configuration of the farms (i.e. changing land use towards fodder production, improving manure handling and/or changing cattle breeds). In 10-year simulations of the baseline, current scenario using historical weather data the wealthiest farms Type 2 achieved food self-sufficiency (FSS) in 20{\%} of the seasons due to rainfall variability, whereas the poorer Type 4 only achieved FSS in 0 to 30{\%} of the seasons; soil organic C decreased during the simulations at annual rates of -0.54, -0.73, -0.85 and -0.84 t C ha-1 on farms of Type 1-4, respectively; large differences in productivity and recycling efficiency between farm types indicated that there is ample room to improve the physical performance of the poorer farms (e.g. light and water use efficiency was 2-3 times larger on wealthier farms). Simulating different intensification scenarios indicated that household FSS can be achieved in all farm types through input intensification, e.g. using P fertilisers at rates as small as 15 kg farm-1 season-1 (i.e. from 7 to 28 kg ha-1). Increasing the area under Napier grass from c. 20 to 40{\%} and reducing the area of maize, beans and sweet potato in farms of Type 3 and 4 increased their primary productivity by c. 1 t ha-1 season-1, their milk production by 156 and 45 L season-1, respectively, but decreased the production of edible energy (by 2000 and 250 MJ ha-1 season-1) and protein (by 20 and 3 kg ha-1 season-1). By bringing in a more productive cow the primary productivity increased even further in Farm Type 3 (up to 5 t ha-1 season-1), as did milk production (up to c. 1000 L season-1), edible energy (up to c. 10,000 MJ ha-1 season-1) and protein (up to c. 100 kg ha-1 season-1). The impact of livestock management on the recycling of nutrients and on the efficiency of nutrient use at farm scale can be large, provided that enough nutrients are present in or enter the system to be redistributed. An increase in N cycling efficiency through improved manure handling from 25 to 50{\%} would increase the amount of N cycled in the case study farms of Type 1 and 2 by only ca. 10 kg season-1, and only 1-2 kg season-1 in Type 3 and 4. The various alternatives simulated when disregarding resource constraints contributed to narrow the productivity and efficiency gaps between poorer and wealthier farms. However, the feasibility of implementing such interventions on a large number of farms is questionable. Implications for system (re-)design and intensification strategies are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids differ in their response to plant population density. Enhancements in tolerance to crowding have been obtained around the world as the result of selecting the best yielding hybrids at dense stands over a wide testing area. However, the understanding of morpho-physiological determinants of maize endurance to the population density stress still needs improvement. This study aimed to evaluate the response of maize hybrids from different eras grown extensively in Brazil to the increase in plant sowing density and to identify agronomic traits that can account for the contrasting tolerance to high interplant competition. The trial was conducted in Lages, southern Brazil, during the growing seasons of 1999/2000 and 2000/2001. A split plot design was used. The double-cross hybrids Agroceres 12, Agroceres 303, and the single-cross hybrid Cargill 929, commercially released during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, respectively, were evaluated in the main plots. Four plant population densities were tested in the split plots: 25,000, 50,000, 75,000 and 100,000 plants ha-1. Maize was sown in no-tillage system, having black oat as the preceding winter crop. Canopy architecture parameters, tassel dry matter accumulation, flower synchrony, grain yield and its components were evaluated. The older hybrids Agroceres 12 and Agroceres 303 out-yielded modern-hybrid C 929 at the lowest plant population density. The increase in plant population increased barrenness, lengthened the anthesis-silking interval and decreased kernel set per ear more drastically for the older than for the modern-hybrid. Consequently, the higher the number of plants per unit area, the greater the edge between grain yield and kernel number per area of C 929 in relation to its older counterparts. Current hybrid's better performance at supraoptimum plant population densities was favored by three sets of traits. First, by lower dry matter partition to the tassel, stimulating a more balanced allometric relationship between male and female inflorescence. Second, by a more compact canopy architecture, with shorter plants, fewer and more upright leaves, enhancing solar radiation interception. Third, by low ear insertion to plant height ratio, promoting greater resistance to stalk lodging. These traits contributed to higher grain yield and positive response to higher densities in the modern-hybrid. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Production will have to have increased massively, but also labor productivity, requiring a vast reduction in the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture and a large move out of rural areas. The paper questions how this can be squared with a continuing commitment to smallholder agriculture as the main route for growth in African agriculture and for poverty reduction. We question the evidence base for an exclusive focus on smallholders, and argue for a much more open-minded approach to different modes of production. To allow alternative modes and scale of production to emerge, new institutional and policy frameworks are required. A rush to establish "mega-farms" with government discretionary allocation of vast tracts of land is unlikely to be the answer. Allowing a more dynamic agriculture to develop will require clear institutional frameworks, and not just a narrow focus on smallholders. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Farmers in central highlands of Kenya experience declining agricultural productivity majorly due to soil desiccation and soil fertility depletion. In order to increase crop productivity, and reduce production risks, improved nutrient use efficiency is required. One way of reversing the trend of declining land productivity in smallholder farms in Kenya, is believed to be the combined application of organic and mineral sources of nutrients. In order to investigate this, field trials were established in a dry land environment in Central Kenya, at Machang'a. The objective of the research was to assess the effect of organic and inorganic inputs on soil nutrients in semi arid regions of the Central Highlands of Kenya. The study was carried out in Mbeere District, Kenya from 2004 to 2010 and the trial followed a randomised complete block design with three replications. The treatments consisted of four organic sources (Tithonia diversifolia, Lantana camara, Mucuna pruriens and goat manure) combined with mineral nitrogen fertilizer, sole fertilizer and a control. Goat manure was superior in terms of improving soil chemical properties such as soil pH, magnesium, potassium, calcium and nitrogen across the sites. Soil pH declined in most of the treatments, more so with the combinations of organics and mineral fertilizers compared to the sole application of organics such as Lantana camara, Mucuna pruriens and manure. Calcium in the soil increased significantly in sole Lantana camara, sole manure and Tithonia diversifolia + 30 kg N ha-1 treatments (t-test, p = 0.029, p = 0.022, and p =0.0264, respectively). Soil potassium increased significantly in manure + 30 kg N ha-1 (t-test, p = 0.017). Soil organic carbon decreased in all the treatments except in the sole manure treatment and manure + 30 kg N ha-1. The decline in soil organic carbon was significant in sole Lantana camara, Lantana camara+ 30 kg N ha-1, sole Tithonia diversifolia, Tithonia diversifolia + 30 kg N ha-1, sole Mucuna pruriens, Mucuna pruriens+ 30 kg N ha-1, fertilizer (60 kg N ha-1) and control treatments (t-test, p = 0.012, p = 0.033, p = 0.0224, p = 0.0166, p = 0.0349, p = 0.0129, p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0341, respectively). Goat manure needs to be promoted among farmers in the drier areas because of its good performance in improving soil properties.},

abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100-110{\%} increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO 2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y -1 and N use ∼250 Mt y -1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y -1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y -1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

On the fringes of modern intensive agriculture, intercropping is important in many subsistence or low-input/resource-limited agricultural systems. By allowing genuine yield gains without increased inputs, or greater stability of yield with decreased inputs, intercropping could be one route to delivering 'sustainable intensification'. We discuss how recent knowledge from agronomy, plant physiology and ecology can be combined with the aim of improving intercropping systems. Recent advances in agronomy and plant physiology include better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between crop genotypes and species - for example, enhanced resource availability through niche complementarity. Ecological advances include better understanding of the context-dependency of interactions, the mechanisms behind disease and pest avoidance, the links between above- and below-ground systems, and the role of microtopographic variation in coexistence. This improved understanding can guide approaches for improving intercropping systems, including breeding crops for intercropping. Although such advances can help to improve intercropping systems, we suggest that other topics also need addressing. These include better assessment of the wider benefits of intercropping in terms of multiple ecosystem services, collaboration with agricultural engineering, and more effective interdisciplinary research.},

abstract = {Many soils in Western Kenya are acidic and deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus. Acidity hinders crop responses to fertilizers applied to remedy nutrient deficiencies. The common liming materials used to ameliorate acidity are Calcium Oxide (CaO) and Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) in powdery formulations. Broadcasting these materials by hand followed by incorporation is recommended on smallholder farms to enhance their effectiveness but this is laborious. Granular lime which is easier to handle was recently introduced but there is little information on its effectiveness. This study therefore tested the effects of CaCO3, CaO and granulated lime, applied alone or in combination with fertilizer (Diammonium phosphate (DAP) + calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)), on maize yield for three seasons, 2015 long rains (LR), 2015 short rains (SR) and 2016 LR at four sites: Butere, Emuhaya, Mumias and Kakamega North in Western Kenya. CaCO3 and CaO were applied at 2 t ha-1 once in the 2015 LR while granular lime was applied at a ratio of 1:1 with DAP per season. There was no significant effect of lime type on maize yields. Maize did not respond to lime without fertilizer. Application of lime, irrespective of the type, with fertilizer, did not give yields that were significantly different from those of fertilizers alone except at Butere in the 2015 LR when application of CaO and CaCO3 with fertilizer significantly out yielded those with fertilizer applied alone. Similar results were obtained with granular lime in the 2015 SR at Emuhaya. It was concluded that except for Butere, where maize did not respond to fertilizer alone, the other sites are not sufficiently acid to permit the solubility of Al to toxic levels for maize. More attention should therefore be focused on N and P replenishment at these sites than liming. At Butere, soil acidity is a problem and lime should be applied together with fertilizers. Key words: Aluminum toxicity, lime, maize, nitrogen, phosphorus.  },

abstract = {Increasing planting density is the main method and key management to enhance the grain yield. Preventing lodging and premature senescence in high planting density, and screening and enhancing the density-tolerance of maize variety is the main goal of agronomy. Differential response of maize hybrids to high plant density greatly affect the dry matter accumulation and its allocation to maize kernel, depending upon various traits responsible for crowding stress tolerance, of which ear characteristics are pivotal. Density resistance as a quality appraisal of certain variety permits the construction of a simple and accurate method to determine this value, useful for plant breeding. Therefore, we created a new quantitative method, which tested several maize varieties planted populary in China (e.g. Zhengdan 958, Xianyu 335, and Denghai 661) to quantify their response to crowding stress through model. We established 13 planting densities (ranging 1.67–16.67 plants m−2) by adopting fixed line spacing (80 × 40 cm) and then gradually increasing row spacing from 1 m to increasing planting density. A conventional standard plot was also established for verification and evaluation of the plant morphologic characteristics, ear traits, and the yield of maize at various standard densities during 5-year study period. By studying the density–yield relationship, a quantitative model was constructed to identify the density resistance of maize. Grain yield of maize varieties under varying planting densities were simulated, and models of population yield and yield per plant that fitted the data well with high biological significance were produced. From the models, the optimal density of the popular main maize varieties planted in China and the morphological characteristics of each variety at that density were identified. The density-resistance of each variety was referred to as the ear-sensitivity classification. With the highest yield at the optimal density, the plant height of each variety reached 98{\%} to that of tallest plant. The ear/plant ratio was about 0.45, and the ratio between the stem diameter and the largest stem diameter was 0.65–0.80. During the harvest period, the ratio between average single-plant yield and the highest single-plant yield was 0.40–0.50. By gradually increasing planting density, the density resistance of the maize and the changes in yield with density were quantified. Present study provides a convenient tool for the effective selection of varieties by plant breeders through this method and model will help to rapidly identify the density resistance for a new variety and accurate confirmation to optimal planting density, it could be optimized to enable practical production at reasonable planting densities.},

Our objective was to determine whether AF systems' recommendations that solely consider impacts on average maize yields differ from those that include an analysis of production risk, profitability among different wealth groups and socioeconomic vulnerability. Employing participatory quantitative and qualitative on-farm research techniques, we investigated three AF-based maize/legume relay-cropping practices in southern Malawi. The perennial legumes included Sesbania sesban, Tephrosia vogelii and Cajanus cajan (pigeonpea). We found that AF species recommendations did diverge from those based solely on maximizing maize yields when incorporating risk, profitability and socioeconomic vulnerability as additional variables. For instance, the highest yielding system (the S. sesban/maize relay crop) was never recommended for the most vulnerable farmers based on the vulnerability analysis, and the cropping systems were often more profitable for the least vulnerable farmers than they were for the most vulnerable farmers. Cropping system recommendations based solely on obtaining the highest average maize yields would also have generally overlooked the economic and nutritional importance of pigeonpea, and the difficulty for the most vulnerable farmers to profit from fertilizers, potentially placing these farmers at greater risk. {\textcopyright}2010 Earthscan.},

However, smallholder farmers, who provide 80{\%} of the food supply in Asia and Africa are the most vulnerable, as access to information is most difficult for them. The connected crop solution for smallholder farmers provides personalized crop advices, optimum usage of fertilizers and pesticides at the right time, and the knowledge to apply those by connecting field agents, agro-input companies, and farmers, resulting in increased crop yield. The application on the mobile device provides personalized advisories with data on the Cloud and connects the producers to labs, agents, nutrient suppliers, insect control suppliers and others. A rule-based, contextual recommendation engine turns a generalist field agent into a knowledge worker. At the same time, the system drives a rigorous sales process for the agro-input companies through their field agent's mobile device, prompting the agent to gather information from the farmer and deliver advice to the farmer at critical points in the crop growth cycle. The solution addresses the needs of the three stakeholders in rural agriculture - field agent, agro-input company, and farmer, significantly improve agent productivity, product sales, and farmer crop yield respectively. A six-month field trial conducted by Accenture Technology Labs with a large agro input company in five districts of Karnataka, India, resulted in an average of 15{\%} increase in crop yields, with improvements for some cash crops exceeding 30{\%}. The field agent productivity also doubled during this period with a 56{\%} y-o-y sales increase for the agro-input company.},

abstract = {Working Paper 26 (2006) ii Abstract A consensus exists that extension services, if functioning effectively, improve agricultural productivity through providing farmers with information that helps them to optimize their use of limited resources. Variations in management practices and husbandry skills among small farmers in Kenya are very wide. Tremendous poverty-reducing benefits could be reaped by bringing the unit production costs of the most inefficient farmers to mean levels. Achieving these gains in agricultural production efficiency will depend on many factors, but extension is likely to be among the most important. Therefore, the costs to the nation of having an under-performing extension service – in terms of smallholder productivity, incomes, and poverty reduction, and the ability to survive or even thrive after the reduction in import tariffs as implied by impending COMESA and EAC trade agreements – are very high. The objective of this study is to assess the range of alternative food crop and livestock extension services currently operating in Kenya. The report is primarily descriptive, providing knowledge on the nature of the existing extension providers, their characteristics, approaches employed and the challenges they face. Based on successful cases, we identify attributes that may be important for future discussions about extension service provision in Kenya and the role of the government in such a scenario. The study covered 16 districts representing the various agro-regional zones present in Kenya. It employed qualitative methods and focused on private and public extension service providers. Discussions were also held with other stakeholders in the agricultural extension service realm about their experiences and perceptions of the existing extension systems and approaches. The study highlights five important findings: (1) private extension provision is generally skewed towards high agricultural potential regions and high-value crops. Remote areas and poor producers, especially those growing low-value crops with little marketable surplus, are poorly served. Non-profit private providers are targeting them, but their reach is limited. (2) Since public resources for extension are very constrained, it may make sense for public extension not to duplicate or overlap in the same areas that are being served more efficiently by commercial and non-profit systems. This would leave more public resources for concentrating extension services for farmers in areas that are remote and poorly served by the commercial systems. (3) However, the commercial and non-profit extension systems benefit from the presence of the public extension service-they rely on public extension workers for training and appropriate management advice. So even if the public extension system was to withdraw to the more remote areas where private extension is unprofitable, it may be appropriate to institute some type of commercial contracting of public extension system staff so that the latter can impart needed skills and capacity building to the non-public extension systems. (4) The government should consider contracting the private sector to offer extension services in the disadvantaged regions. Contracting out extension services makes it possible to take advantage of all of the talent and experience existing in the field but does not eliminate a government role which, in addition to funding, ensures quality assurance, oversight, and provision of training and information to contracted services providers. (5) The weight of evidence suggests, in most cases, that private extension is not a substitute for public extension and the public sector should fund extension significantly but in ways that do not duplicate services already being provided by sustainable alternative extension providers.},

abstract = {For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.},

The experiment tested five different cropping systems: sole cropping of each crop, as well as intercropping of maize/bean with the ratios of 1:3 (M1B3), 2:2 (M2B2) and 3:1 (M3B1), each of which took place in the presence of two weed management systems (no weed control and weed eradication through manual removal), in a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design using three replicates. Tests of homogeneity of variance for combined data over two years showed that data of both years could be analyzed together. The results showed that the effect of intercropping treatments on all measured traits in maize and bean were significantly different. A minimum land equivalent ratio (LER) for maize (0.78) was obtained for M3B1 under conditions of no weed control, while the highest LER (1.03) was observed in M3B1 under weed-free conditions. The highest (0.99) and lowest (0.70) LER values for beans were recorded for M1B3 under weed-free conditions and M3B1 under conditions of no weed control, respectively. M1B3 under weed-free conditions showed the highest total LER (2.02), while M3B1 under conditions of no weed control showed the lowest (1.48). Results of this study indicated that intercropping bean and maize can be an effective method to increase total productivity, and that the M1B3 system was the best cropping system for high productivity. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of Korea.},

abstract = {The objective of this article is to provide experimental data and new insights about the best P fertilization strategy for phosphorus (P) fixing soils in the tropics. Two controversial strategies to manage soils with high phosphorus (P) fixation capacity were compared with regard to effects on maize (Zea mays L.) yields and the fate of fertilizer P in soil. One strategy was broadcasting and incorporation of fertilizer P to quench P-fixation of the whole topsoil; the other strategy was subseed placement of fertilizer P to each crop to quench P-fixation in small volumes just below the plant. Field trials with maize as test crop were carried out on granite, rhyolite, basalt, felsite-andesite, and volcanic ash soils in south-west Kenya during three growing seasons. Incorporation rates ranged from 66 to 2096 kg ha-1 P, and placement rates from 11 to 131 kg ha-1. Fertilized soils were analyzed regularly over a period of about 600 days. Grain yields responded strongly to P, except on the P-rich volcanic ash soil. Among the other soils, felsite-andesite had the least response to incorporated P as well as to placed P. In fertilized soil layers, $\Delta$total P was higher for placed than for incorporated P. The ratio of $\Delta$P-Olsen/$\Delta$total P did not change over time. It was lower in P-fixing felsite-andesite than in non-fixing volcanic ash, and higher for placed P than for incorporated P. The crop's response was related to calculated volumes of P-enriched soil. Placement gave higher yields than incorporation at P rates {\textless}50 kg ha-1, especially on soils with low yields. The residual effect was high because P-Olsen in the fertilized soil remained far above the values required for optimum growth. It was somewhat lower for placed than for incorporated P. Placement of P at low rates repeated in each season was better than a single placement at higher rates in the first season only, because placed fertilizer was in subsequent seasons not as close to the roots as in the first season. In conclusion, high P retention of soils did not adversely affect the response to fertilizer P. Low-input is preferred above high-input because of higher P use efficiency, less weed growth, and easier adoption by farmers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The objectives of this study were to: develop Al tolerant maize inbred lines for a maize breeding program in Kenya, develop single cross hybrids (SCHs) from some of the tolerant inbred lines and determine Al tolerance levels of the SCHs. One hundred and seventy five inbreds and 49 SCHs were developed and screened in nutrient culture containing 0 or 222 µM using Relative Net Root Growth (RNRG), hematoxylin staining (HS) and under Al saturated field conditions (44{\%}-45.6{\%}) at Sega and Chepkoilel. Seedling root growth was inhibited in 95{\%} of the inbreds. F 1 hybrids obtained from inbreds varying in Al tolerance, exhibited tolerance equal to or greater than that of the more tolerant parent indicating a positive transgressive inheritance to Al toxicity. Fifty eight percent of the F 1 SCHs were heterotic for tolerance to Al toxicity. Al tolerance estimated by RNRG was well correlated to that of HS (r 2 = 0.88, P {\textless} 0.005) but minimally correlated with the field estimates (r 2 = 0.24-0.35), implying that RNRG can predict field selection under Al toxic soils by between 24{\%} and 35{\%}.

abstract = {The decrease in crop yields at increasing distances from the homesteads within smallholder farms of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is normally ascribed to the existence of within-farm soil fertility gradients. Field observations also suggest that a large part of such variability is concomitantly caused by poor agronomy. To understand the interaction between soil fertility (S factors) and management decisions (M factors) affecting crop variability, we combined field research conducted in western Kenya (Vihiga, Kakamega and Teso districts; rainfall: 1600, 1800 and 1200 mm, respectively) with explorations using the simple dynamic crop/soil model for dynamic simulation of nutrient balances, previously tested for the region. Field measurements indicated within-farm differences in average maize grain yields of 48{\%} (2.7 vs. 1.4 t ha-1) in Vihiga and of 60{\%} (1.5 vs. 0.6 t ha-1) in Teso, between fields that were close and far from the homestead, respectively. Extreme values ranged widely, e.g. between 4.9 and 0.3 t ha-1 for all the farms surveyed in Vihiga, where the average farm size was 0.6 ha. Maize grain yields tended to increase with increasing contents of soil C, total N, extractable P and exchangeable bases. However, the negative relationship between S factors and distance from the homestead was not as strong as expected, and yield variability was better explained by multiple regression models considering M factors such as planting date, plant density, resource use and weed infestation (40-60{\%} across sites). Then, we analysed the variation in resource (cash, labour, N) use efficiency within farms of different resource endowments with the aid of the simulation model. N balances at plot scale varied from ca. +20 to -18 kg ha-1, from -9 to -20 kg ha-1 and from -16 to -18 kg ha-1 for the different fields of the high, medium and low resource endowment case-study farms, respectively. Labour productivities ranged between ca. 10 and 38 kg grain man-day-1 across field and farm types. The results indicate the need of considering within farm heterogeneity when designing soil fertility management interventions. Resource use efficiency was strongly affected by soil quality. As farmers invest more effort and resources in the more productive and less risky fields, the interaction between S and M factors leads to farmer-driven resource use efficiency gradients within smallholder farms. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sustainable intensification (SI) is a viable pathway to increase agricultural production and improve ecosystem health. Scaling SI technologies in locations with similar biophysical conditions enhance adoption. This paper employs novel extrapolation detection (ExeDet) algorithm and gridded bioclimatic layers to delineate extrapolation domains for improved maize variety (SC719) and inorganic fertilizers (YaraMila-CEREAL{\textregistered} and YaraBela-Sulfan{\textregistered}) in Tanzania. Suitability was based on grain yields recorded in on-farm trials. The ExeDet algorithm generated three maps: (1) the dissimilarity between bioclimatic conditions in the reference trial sites and the target extrapolation domain (Novelty type-1), (2) the magnitude of novel correlations between covariates in extrapolation domain (Novelty type-2) and (3) the most limiting covariate. The novelty type1 and 2 maps were intersected and reclassified into five suitability classes. These classes were cross-tabulated to generate extrapolation suitability index (ESI) for the candidate technology package. An impact based spatial targeting index (IBSTI) was used to identify areas within the zones earmarked as suitable using ESI where the potential impacts for out scaling interventions can be maximized. Application of ESI and IBSTI is expected to guide extension and development agencies to prioritize scaling intervention based on both biophysical suitability and potential impact of particular technology package. Annual precipitation was most limiting factor in largest area of the extrapolation domain. Identification of the spatial distribution of the limiting factor is useful for recommending remedial measures to address the limiting factor that hinder a technology to achieve its full potential. The method outlined in this paper is replicable to other technologies that require extrapolation provided that representative reference trial data and appropriate biophysical grids are available.},

abstract = {This paper uses comparable income aggregates from 41 national household surveys from 22 countries to explore the patterns of income generation among rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to compare household income strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa with those in other regions. The paper seeks to understand how geography drives these strategies, focusing on the role of agricultural potential and distance to urban areas. Specialization in on-farm activities continues to be the norm in rural Africa, practiced by 52 percent of households (as opposed to 21 percent of households in other regions). Regardless of distance and integration in the urban context, when agro-climatic conditions are favorable, farming remains the occupation of choice for most households in the African countries for which the study has geographically explicit information. However, the paper finds no evidence that African households are on a different trajectory than households in other regions in terms of transitioning to non-agricultural based income strategies.},

abstract = {Integrated natural resources management (INRM), of which integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is a component, offers considerable promise for increasing food production in Kenya. It nonetheless remains unclear whether ISFM/INRM techniques lend themselves easily to adoption by smallholder farmers. Using panel data collected in western Kenya in 1989 and 2002, this study finds that resource constraints limit many farmers' adoption of ISFM/INRM techniques. The size of the farm owned by a household, the value of its livestock, off-farm income, family labor supply, and the educational attainment and gender of the household head all had a significant positive effect on the likelihood of adoption. Similar factors were found to be statistically significant in discouraging abandonment of the practices under study. There thus seem to exist reinforcing feedback between investments in soil fertility management and household wealth, as measured by asset endowments. Our findings raise important questions as to whether ISFM and related techniques are really affordable to poorer smallholder farmers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Climate change and variability are projected to alter the geographic suitability of lands for crop cultivation. In many developing countries, such as Kenya, information on the mean changes in climate is limited. Therefore, in this study, we model the current and future changes in areas suitable for rainfed maize production in the country using a maximum entropy (MaxENT) model. Maize is by far a major staple food crop in Kenya. We used maize occurrence location data and bioclimatic variables for two climatic scenarios-Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 from two general circulation models (HadGEM2-ES and CCSM4) for 2070. The study identified the annual mean temperature, annual precipitation and the mean temperature of the wettest quarter as the major variables that affect the distribution of maize. Simulation results indicate an average increase of unsuitable areas of between 1.9–3.9{\%} and a decrease of moderately suitable areas of 14.6–17.5{\%}. The change in the suitable areas is an increase of between 17–20{\%} and in highly suitable areas of 9.6{\%} under the climatic scenarios. The findings of this study are of utmost importance to the country as they present an opportunity for policy makers to develop appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies required to sustain maize production under future climates.},

abstract = {Innovation in agronomy by large numbers of smallholder farmers will need to accelerate if global commitments to end hunger are to be achieved in the face of major climate and other global change that are both caused by, and impact, agriculture. Conventional research and development in agronomy have involved a research process that produces technologies, which are then promoted for uptake by large numbers of farmers through extension, with both research and extension phases being more or less participatory. Recent research, including key contributions to this special issue, reveals that the performance of many technology options varies hugely across the geographies over which development programmes operate, depending on social, economic and ecological context. This severely limits the value of attempting to produce recommendations for large areas and numbers of farmers and identifies the need for new ways of supporting innovation that address the real-world heterogeneity of farmer circumstances. Addressing this widespread phenomenon of option by context interaction (OxC) has profound implications for how agronomic research and development are organised. Papers in this special issue show the nature and implications of such interactions and suggest ways in which research and development systems need to respond in order to support locally relevant innovation. It is evident that a paradigm shift is well underway, with researchers embracing new modes of thinking and action required to address OxC interactions, but these also need to be taken up and further developed by extension and change agents in the public and private sector. It is only through continued co-development of methods involving both these constituencies, working closely with farmers that sufficient progress is likely to be made for smallholder farming to keep pace with global demand for food without further damaging the environmental resources upon which production is based.},

abstract = {Cropland mapping relies heavily on field data for algorithm calibration, making it, in many cases, applicable only at the field campaign scale. While the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite will be able to deliver time series over large regions, it will not really be compatible with the current mapping approach or the available in situ data. This research introduces a generic methodology for mapping annual cropland along the season at high spatial resolution with the use of globally available baseline land cover and no need for field data. The methodology is based on cropland-specific temporal features, which are able to cope with the diversity of agricultural systems, prior information from which mislabeled pixels have been removed and a cost-effective classifier. Thanks to the JECAM network, eight sites across the world were selected for global cropland mapping benchmarking. Accurate cropland maps were produced at the end of the season, showing an overall accuracy of more than 85{\%}. Early cropland maps were also obtained at three-month intervals after the beginning of the growing season, and these showed reasonable accuracy at the three-month stage ({\textgreater}70{\%} overall accuracy) and progressive improvement along the season. The trimming-based method was found to be key for using spatially coarse baseline land cover information and, thus, avoiding costly field campaigns for prior information retrieval. The accuracy and timeliness of the proposed approach shows that it has substantial potential for operational agriculture monitoring programs.},

abstract = {Agriculture as a source of food has a substantial spillover that affects the Earth's ecosystems. This results in an 'ecological footprint' of food: negative environmental impacts per capita. The footprint depends on the dietary choice of types and amounts of food, on the non-consumed part of product flows and its fate ('waste' or 'reused'), on transport and processing along the value chain, on the environmental impacts of production per unit area, and on the area needed per unit product. Yield gaps indicate inefficiency in this last aspect: resource-use efficiency gaps for water and nutrients indicate that environmental impacts per unit area are higher than desirable. Ecological intensification aimed at simultaneously closing these two gaps requires process-level understanding and system-level quantification of current efficiency of the use of land and other production factors at multiple scales (field, farm, landscape, regional and global economy). Contrary to common opinion, yield and efficiency gaps are partially independent in the empirical evidence. Synergy in gap closure is possible in many contexts where efforts are made but are not automatic. With Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), enforceable in world trade to control hidden subsidies, there is scope for incremental improvement towards food systems that are efficient at global, yet sustainable at local, scales. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The population of Africa will double in the next 33 years to reach 2.5 billion by 2050. Although roughly 60{\%} of the continent's population is engaged in agriculture, the produce from this sector cannot feed its citizens. Hence, in 2013 alone, Africa imported 56.5 million tons of wheat, maize, and soybean at the cost of 18.8 billion USD. Although crops cultivated in Africa play a vital role in their contribution to Food Security, they produce inferior yields compared to those in other parts of the world. For instance, the average cereal yield in Africa is only 1.6 t-ha-1 compared to the global 3.9 t-ha-1. Low productivity in Africa is also related to poor soil fertility and scarce moisture, as well as a variety of insect pests, diseases, and weeds. While moisture scarcity is responsible for up to 60{\%} of yield losses in some African staple cereals, insect pests inflict annually substantial crop losses. In order to devise a strategy towards boosting crop productivity on the continent where food insecurity is most prevalent, these production constraints should be investigated and properly addressed. This review focuses on conventional (also known as genetic) intensification in which crop productivity is raised through breeding for cultivars with high yield-potential and those that thrive well under diverse and extreme environmental conditions. Improved crop varieties alone do not boost crop productivity unless supplemented with optimum soil, water, and plant management practices as well as the promotion of policies pertaining to inputs, credit, extension, and marketing. Studies in Kenya and Uganda have shown that the yield of cassava can be increased by 140{\%} in farmers' fields using improved varieties and management practices. In addition to traditional organic and inorganic fertilizers, biochar and African Dark Earths have been found to improve soil properties and to enhance productivity, although their availability and affordability to African farmers remains to be explored. The concept of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) has been successfully implemented in some African countries in the Great Lake Region. Other innovative technologies favorably accepted by farmers are the "Push-pull System" (an elegant method of controlling a devastating insect pest and a parasitic weed) and NERICA (New Rice for Africa, in which rice varieties with desirable nutritional and agronomic properties were developed by crossing Asian and African rice). This review calls for African governments and institutions not only to provide conducive environments but also to abide by the Maputo 2003 Declaration where they agreed to invest 10{\%} of their national budget to agricultural research and development as the outcome has a positive impact on productivity and ultimately improves the livelihood of farmers.},

abstract = {This paper outlines three agricultural and rural extension market reforms and two non-marketing reforms, at all times emphasizing stakeholder, and particularly end-user, participation in the approaches employed in these reforms. It also rec- ognizes the need for non-farm microenterprise development initiatives, and advocates coordinating this effort with other international organizations. The paper recommends that FAO should explore these and related institutional reform options with the developing countries, as an important means of assisting them to revitalize their agricultural and rural extension systems. In the present climate of change, poverty alleviation and food security are major concerns to FAO and its member states. This was evidenced at the 1996 World Food Summit, at which the representatives of FAO member countries pledged their dedication to alleviating poverty using every means available. Agricultural and rural extension is one of the means available to help alleviate poverty and improve food security. It promotes the transfer and exchange of information that can be converted into functional knowledge, which is instrumental in helping to develop enterprises that promote productivity and generate income.In addition to technology transfer, agricultural and rural extension is a unique service in that it provides access by small farmers and the rural poor living far from the urban centres to non-formal education and information services. While it can provide these populations with services to increase their productivity, their food security will depend on institutional development and income-generation, together with increased food crop output. Studies of food security and malnutri- tion (Von Braun 1993) have concluded that the primary cause of malnutrition in the less developed countries is not the scarcity of food so much as distribution problems, and the existence of poverty. In a major report on world agriculture, the World Bank stated: «...in the long run, people can attain food security only if they have adequate income.» On the subject of productivity, FAO's Director-General notes that «farm output by small farmers in low-income food-deficit countries is feasible (often using quite simple and low-cost technologies) and can, under most circumstances, achieve the combined objectives of improving rural livelihoods, increasing food supplies with- in rural communities, having a multiplier effect on economic growth, and reducing foreign exchange expenditure on food imports» (FAO 2001). Similar assumptions underlie the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach espoused by the UK's Department for International Development, the Sasakawa Global-2000 programme and the Soil Fertility Initiative. It is becoming increasingly more evident that the long-term solu- tion to world hunger lies in “helping the poor to produce more and better-quality staple food more efficiently in order to take the first step out of poverty” (Diouf2000). This implies the need to raise farm productivity per unit of input, improve the competitiveness of food marketing systems (so that local producers have incen- tives to raise productivity when faced by the reality or prospect of cheaper food imports), and raise the incomes of the poor throughout the developing world. Certainly, if farmers are to increase production, adequate attention needs to be paid to helping them keep their production costs per unit competitive with prevailing market prices, which are notoriously fickle (FAO 1987). Yet, as the FAO's The State of Food and Agriculture 2000 concludes: Reducing poverty and food insecurity is not simply a question of enhancing agri- cultural productivity and production or of generating more income. Institutions are the structuring features that command access of people to assets, to voice and to power over their lives and that regulate competing claims to limited resources. It is fundamental to address those institutional, governance and politico-econom- ic factors that tend to exclude individuals and population groups from progress. Perhaps it goes without saying that extension as an institution is only one com- ponent in agricultural and rural development processes, and that it is only one vehicle for fostering change in agricultural and rural development. Yet the impor- tance of knowledge and the rapidity of its transfer and exchange in the modern world are increasingly recognized as central to trade and development, in high- income as well as in low-income countries (Drucker 1998; Zijp 1994). Extension's high economic rates of return indicate its potential to bring about change (Birkhaeuser, Evenson {\&} Feder 1988). The world has entered a new economic sys- tem that has evolved from «structural adjustment» and trade liberalization, and also from technological progress and advances in telecommunications and greater interdependence of the world labour, product, and financial markets. While knowledge and capital are becoming increasingly more central to achieving suc- cess in this new economic system, some countries have yet to consider the value of making knowledge available through revived extension services. The pres- sures of the new economy may soon induce these countries to re-examine their extension institutions and their extension institutional arrangements with a view to reforming and revitalizing them. The extension reforms being adopted worldwide offer new ways of viewing and addressing the issue of agricultural and rural development. Change today is global and rapid. A new paradigm has emerged towards a mar- ket-driven, agribusiness orientation, stressing comparative advantage in a highly competitive global market. This globalization and market orientation is placing new pressures on governments and their people to produce more, for both domestic consumption and trade. At the same time, the developing countries have implemented structural adjust- ments that have made them reduce public spending on services. But the inter- national organizations are nevertheless urging the developing countries to foster educational activities and enhance their human capital. The commitment to poverty alleviation and food security is an expression of that concern, especially for rural areas remote from the urban centres. Although learning via agricultural extension services is only one component of the complex process of development, studies suggest that this process produces high economic rates of return (Birkhaeuser, Evenson, {\&} Feder 1988). Few would deny that work-related functional knowledge is central to economic success. In the present context of change, one of the challenges facing FAO is how to promote the economic success of the countries that represent the billion or so people who lack the functional knowledge which agricultural and rural extension can help to provide.},

On the basis of case studies from varied agricultural and ecological regions in Asia and Africa, chapters discuss the need for adopting new paradigms between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, catchment/micro-watershed management approaches, upgrades in science-based development and more investments in rainfed areas. Yield gaps for major rainfed crops are analysed globally and possible ways and means including technological, social, and institutional options to bridge the yield gaps are discussed in detail.

This experiment examined mycorrhizal assessment, chemical and microbiological soil attributes in a maize-forage grasses intercropping compared to a maize-monocropping system. A complete randomized block design was used with crop systems installed under no-till management with three replicates, as follow: Maize (Zea mays L.); Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Aruana; Urochloa humidicola (Rendle.) Schweickerdt.; Maize-P. maximum intercropping and Maize-U. humidicola intercropping. In 2015/2016 season, intercropping maize with Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Aruana or Urochloa humidicola (Rendle.)

Similar grain yield was verified among maize crop systems. This result indicates that intercropping maize-tropical forage grasses represents an alternative for monocropped grains, a very common practice that is used in intensive management, being able to guarantee equivalent productivities and to combine grain production with crop-livestock systems. As a result, intercropping promotes the diversification of the property's income source, adding environmental gains, such as more efficient land use by cultivated plants, keeping soil constantly cultivated, storing carbon and contributing to minimize the impact of climate change on agricultural systems and the sustainability of food production.},

abstract = {The spatial variability in crop yields commonly observed in smallholder farms of sub-Saharan Africa is often caused by gradients of declining soil fertility with increasing distance from the homestead. This heterogeneity means that recommendations based on regional soil surveys are of limited value. The variability in soil qualities within farms must be considered when designing management strategies, and their feasibility analysed by integrating results at the farm livelihood scale. For this purpose, we have developed the model FARMSIM, a dynamic bio-economic model for analysis and exploration of trade-offs in resource and labour allocation in heterogeneous smallholder farms. Focusing on farm-scale strategies, the approach to simulation of soil and crop processes in FARMSIM (the sub-model FIELD) is designed to be simple, but to keep the necessary degree of complexity to capture heterogeneity in resource use efficiencies. To test our approach, the sub-model FIELD was calibrated against chronosequences of woodland clearance in three agroecological zones of Zimbabwe (with soil textures of 3, 10, 35{\%} clay), and used to simulate: (i) the creation of soil fertility gradients, and (ii) different strategies of N, P and manure applications to maize and soyabean rotations in homefields and outfields of smallholder farms on clayey and sandy soils. The results of the simulation of management strategies were tested against on-farm experimental data from Murewa, Zimbabwe. The model produced satisfactory predictions (r2: 0.6-0.9) of long-term changes in soil organic C, of crop responses to N and P and of nutrient use efficiencies across a wide range of yields and different field types. This demonstrated the broad applicability of the model despite the sparse data required for initialisation. However, the model results were less accurate in predicting crop responses to N and P applications in the outfields on sandy soils. Experimental evidence indicated yield limitation by Ca and Zn deficiencies in highly depleted outfields on sandy soils, which were not included mechanistically in the current version of FIELD. Repeated applications of 16 t ha-1 year-1 of manure allowed larger responses to applied N and P after 3 years of experimentation; such a corrective effect of manure was simulated to be due to improved N and P recovery efficiencies in the model. In combination with the experimental data, the simulation results suggested that soil fertility gradients affect nutrient use efficiencies, operating mostly on the efficiencies of nutrient capture rather than conversion. A typology of fields according to the type of management interventions needed is introduced, based on a generic application of FIELD with this parameterisation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Open-access global Digital Elevation Models (DEM) have been crucial in enabling flood studies in data-sparse areas. Poor resolution ({\textgreater}30m), significant vertical errors and the fact that these DEMs are over a decade old continue to hamper our ability to accurately estimate flood hazard. The limited availability of high-accuracy DEMs dictate that dated open-access global DEMs are still used extensively in flood models, particularly in data-sparse areas. Nevertheless, high-accuracy DEMs have been found to give better flood estimations, and thus can be considered a ‘must-have' for any flood model. A high-accuracy open-access global DEM is not imminent, meaning that editing or stochastic simulation of existing DEM data will remain the primary means of improving flood simulation. This article provides an overview of errors in some of the most widely used DEM data sets, along with the current advances in reducing them via the creation of new DEMs, editing DEMs and stochastic simulation of DEMs. We focus on a geostatistical approach to stochastically simulate floodplain DEMs from several open-access global DEMs based on the spatial error structure. This DEM simulation approach enables an ensemble of plausible DEMs to be created, thus avoiding the spurious precision of using a single DEM and enabling the generation of probabilistic flood maps. Despite this encouraging step, an imprecise and outdated global DEM is still being used to simulate elevation. To fundamentally improve flood estimations, particularly in rapidly-changing developing regions, a high-accuracy open-access global DEM is urgently needed, which in turn can be used in DEM simulation.},

abstract = {The development of crop varieties that are better suited to new climatic conditions is vital for future food production. Increases in mean temperature accelerate crop development, resulting in shorter crop durations and reduced time to accumulate biomass and yield. The process of breeding, delivery and adoption (BDA) of new maize varieties can take up to 30 years. Here, we assess for the first time the implications of warming during the BDA process by using five bias-corrected global climate models and four representative concentration pathways with realistic scenarios of maize BDA times in Africa. The results show that the projected difference in temperature between the start and end of the maize BDA cycle results in shorter crop durations that are outside current variability. Both adaptation and mitigation can reduce duration loss. In particular, climate projections have the potential to provide target elevated temperatures for breeding. Whilst options for reducing BDA time are highly context dependent, common threads include improved recording and sharing of data across regions for the whole BDA cycle, streamlining of regulation, and capacity building. Finally, we show that the results have implications for maize across the tropics, where similar shortening of duration is projected.},

abstract = {The major challenge of the 21st century is to achieve food security under, roughly, a doubling in food demand by 2050 compared to present, and producing the additional food under marked shifts in climatic risks and with environmentally sound farming practices. Sustainable intensification of agricultural production is required that meets the dual goal of improved environmental sustainability and economic efficiency. Ex ante evaluation of technological innovations to support agricultural production and food security taking into account the various future risks can substantially contribute to achieve this. Here we perceive technological innovations as new or improved agro-technologies and – management practices, such as new breeds, integrated soil fertility practices or labour-saving technologies meeting the goals of sustainable intensification.   In this report we present results from three systematic reviews: one on the use of biophysical modelling, the second and third on the use of bio-economic modelling at farm scale and agro-economic modelling at higher aggregation levels, for ex ante evaluation of the effects of (agro-) Technological Innovations (ag-TIs) on sustainable agriculture and food security indicators. To this end, we searched the SCOPUS database for journal articles published between 1996 and 2015. We considered modelling studies at different spatial scales with particular attention to local to national scale studies for the twelve PARI focal countries in Africa. But we also included studies for all other African countries as well as a few studies at supra-national/continental scale. Both, “quick wins” as well as long term benefits from ag-TIs were of interest. The various ag-TIs were furthermore grouped into four classes: (1) water/soil moisture (2) soil nutrients/conservation (3) crop/cropping system, (4) other ag-TIs or (5) combinations of 1 to 4. For each paper, we tried to identify the primary ag-TI analysed, and if there was equal emphasis to more than one, we classified them as combinations. It should be borne in mind that there is some subjectivity in classifying the papers in this way.  Results. After various steps of refining “search strings”, screening on relevance and supplementing databases from additional sources, we found 140 relevant biophysical modelling studies, whereby coverage of sub-regions and ag-TIs varied markedly. Most studies were found for East and West Africa, followed by Southern Africa; hardly anything was found for Northern and Middle Africa. A similar pattern appeared for the integrated agro-economic modelling studies at farm scale, for which we found 40 relevant ones. Agro-economic modelling studies at higher aggregation levels showed a somewhat different pattern – and more generally contained little detail on technological innovations. Regarding the share of different primary agro-technologies explored in the biophysical studies we found 45 on crop management, 35 on combined agro-technologies, 31 on soil nutrient management and conservation, 23 on water/soil moisture management, and 6 on other technologies.  We found similar shares among the various agro-technology groups for the integrated agro-economic modelling studies at farm scale.   Looking at the outcomes from ex ante evaluations we found that many studies are (mostly) positive on effects of single and “conventional” ag-TIs. The majority of biophysical studies is performed at “field scale” and focuses on the effects on productivity (sometimes yield stability); many of these studies were performed in climate variability and change/adaptation research context. Most agro-economic modelling studies that look specifically at ex ante evaluations of ag-TIs are performed at farm or regional (sub-national) scales. While the number of biophysically oriented studies has grown exponentially over the considered period 1996-2015, this is not the case for the agro-economic modelling studies.   Looking in more detail at the twelve focal countries of PARI (=Programme of Accompanying Research on Agricultural Innovations)  we also find an unbalanced distribution, with most studies found in Kenya, Ethiopia, Mali and Ghana (biophysical modelling studies), and respectively in Kenya and Uganda (agro-economic modelling studies), whereas nothing or little was found for both types of studies in Togo, Zambia and Nigeria.  Very few of the biophysically-oriented studies include other information than effects on crop yields, and there are few studies for both biophysical and agro-economic modelling that comprise multi-scale or higher scale analyses; if multi-scale, there are more studies that scale up from field/farm to regional/sub-national level than from field/farm to nation scale or beyond. There is definitely a need to overcome the lack of meaningful integrated multi-scale modelling along the lines proposed in chapters 5-6 of this report. Moreover, less than half of all integrated/agro-economic modelling studies at farm scale explicitly address risk – another clear shortcoming, which requires attention by the research community.  A more general conclusion is that there is no application yet of true transdisciplinary research approaches in practice. Hence, there is need for participatory, collaborative (cross-sectoral) and combined modelling approaches with adequate stakeholder involvement throughout the research process. In this respect, some lessons might be learned from pioneering work conducted in Asia and Europe.},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers operate within a risky and uncertain context. In addition to climate variability and climate change, social, environmental, institutional, and market-related dynamics affect their agricultural decisions and ability to cope and adapt. In this paper, we develop and apply a set of framing questions to investigate the factors shaping farmer decision-making and how these are situated in pathways of response. Drawing on a literature review of decision-making for risk management, five questions are posed to frame enquiry: what livelihood decisions are undertaken by households, who makes what decisions, when do households make decisions and why do they make them, and how do decision making processes evolve and response pathways arise. This approach conceptualises and explores household decision-making in a holistic manner, moving beyond previous studies that examine smallholder decisions through disciplinary boundaries (e.g. psychology, economics, risk management) or particular theoretical approaches (e.g. bounded rationality, theory of planned behaviour). The framing questions together with key insights from literature are used to design and interpret empirical evidence from Pratapgarh, a tribal-dominated rainfed district in southeast Rajasthan, India. The findings suggest that while resource ownership and access are the main drivers of decision-making, socio-cognitive factors such as perceived adaptive capacity and perceived efficacy to carry out adaptive actions are equally important factors mediating farmer responses. We also find that the holistic approach helps explain how personal motivations and individual perceptions of adaptive capacity interact with socioeconomic, climatic, and agro-ecological dynamics at local and regional scales to mediate risk perception and inform response behaviour. A typology of response pathways demonstrates how different households' trajectories are determined. Making a case for mixed methods to investigate farmer decision-making holistically, this paper provides an approach that reflects the complex and iterative nature of real farmer decision-making and can be used by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to better understand and describe decision making and to develop informed policies and interventions.},

abstract = {The Government of Nepal has identified opportunities in agricultural commercialization, responding to a growing internal demand and expansion of export markets to reduce the immense trade deficit. Several cash crops, including coffee and bananas, have been identified in the recently approved Agriculture Development Strategy. Both of these crops have encouraged smallholder farmers to convert their subsistence farming practices to more commercial cultivation. Identification of suitable agro-ecological zones and understanding climate-related issues are important for improved production and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Here, the suitability of coffee and banana crops is analyzed for different agro-ecological zones represented by Global Environmental Stratification (GEnS). Future shifts in these suitability zones are also predicted. Plantation sites in Nepal were geo-referenced and used as input in species distribution modelling. The multi-model ensemble model suggests that climate change will reduce the suitable growing area for coffee by about 72{\%} across the selected emission scenarios from now to 2050. Impacts are low for banana growing, with a reduction in suitability by about 16{\%} by 2050. Bananas show a lot of potential for playing an important role in Nepal as a sustainable crop in the context of climate change, as this study indicates that the amount of area suited to banana growing will grow by 40{\%} by 2050. Based on our analysis we recommend possible new locations for coffee plantations and one method for mitigating climate change-related problems on existing plantations. These findings are expected to support planning and policy dialogue for mitigation and support better informed and scientifically based decision-making relating to these two crops.},

abstract = {Farmers can manage their crops and farms better if they can communicate their experiences, both positive and negative, with each other and with experts. Digital agriculture using internet communication technology (ICT) may facilitate the sharing of experiences between farmers themselves and with experts and others interested in agriculture. ICT approaches in agriculture are, however, still out of the reach of many farmers. The reasons are lack of connectivity, missing capacity building and poor usability of ICT applications. We decided to tackle this problem through cost-effective, easy to use ICT approaches, based on infrastructure and services currently available to small-scale producers in developing areas. Working through a participatory design approach, we developed and tested a novel technology. GeoFarmer provides near real-time, two-way data flows that support processes of co-innovation in agricultural development projects. It can be used as a cost-effective ICT-based platform to monitor agricultural production systems with interactive feedback between the users, within pre-defined geographical domains. We tested GeoFarmer in four geographic domains associated with ongoing agricultural development projects in East and West Africa and Latin America. We demonstrate that GeoFarmer is a cost-effective means of providing and sharing opportune indicators of on-farm performance. It is a potentially useful tool that farmers and agricultural practitioners can use to manage their crops and farms better, reduce risk, increase productivity and improve their livelihoods.},

Experts disagree on the status of these very similar taxa, as taste remains the only character by which they can be distinguished in the field. We combined occurrences and environment data in ecological niche models to assess suitable areas for the two species. Irvingia gabonensis presented a wider occurrence area due to cultivation across contrasting ecological areas. Irvingia wombolu does not appear to be cultivated and only occurred in southwestern Togo. These differences in range is likely determined by phenological limitations of I. wombolu, reinforced by differences in local management systems, thus confirming the failure of market development to impact useful plant species' conservation significantly. Highly suitable areas for I. wombolu were in the Volta Forest, where I. gabonensis saw low suitability, while out of this inverse situation was observed, as regard environmental suitability. These differences are significant, implying different ecological adaptation. However, anthropogenic influences, related to domestication history, are also important. Therefore, updated genetic investigations and field trials in contrasting ecological areas are required for understanding the origin of differences between these two forms.},

The increasing threat of climatological extremes including very high temperatures might lead to catastrophic loss of crop productivity and result in wide spread famine. In this review, we assess the impact of global climate change on the agricultural crop production. There is a differential effect of climate change both in terms of geographic location and the crops that will likely show the most extreme reductions in yield as a result of expected extreme fluctuations in temperature and global warming in general. High temperature stress has a wide range of effects on plants in terms of physiology, biochemistry and gene regulation pathways. However, strategies exist to crop improvement for heat stress tolerance. In this review, we present recent advances of research on all these levels of investigation and focus on potential leads that may help to understand more fully the mechanisms that make plants tolerant or susceptible to heat stress. Finally, we review possible procedures and methods which could lead to the generation of new varieties with sustainable yield production, in a world likely to be challenged both by increasing population, higher average temperatures and larger temperature fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Bita and Gerats.},

abstract = {Purpose: Agricultural advisory services are perceived by many actors involved in rural development as a key driver behind innovation processes in agriculture. However, changes in national and global contexts cause dramatic changes in the orientation of advisory services, their organisation and their methods of intervention. This article aims to analyse the major research topics related to agricultural advice.Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an extensive review of literature produced over a ten-year period that is accessible through the CAB, ECONLIT and Web of Science citation indexes. Using keywords related to extension and advisory services, we selected published articles according to the relevance of the results provided in relation to advisory services and the quality of the discussion on past or current controversies.Findings: The results show that the ongoing scientific debates are shaped by the diversity of disciplines, methods, topics and schools of thought. The scientific community largely has focussed on five main themes: (1) the institutional environment of agricultural advisory services; (2) the structures necessary for the operation of an advisory system; (3) the actors providing advisory services and the skills deployed in advisory activities; (4) the approaches, methods, tools and content of advisory activities; and (5) the assessment and impacts of advisory systems.Practical implications: This literature review is useful for researchers and practitioners to better understand research results in the field of advisory services. It paves the way for future research.Originality/Value: Although many articles have been written in recent decades on agricultural advisory services, few studies provide an overview of the contributions of, and debates in, the international scientific community. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Wageningen University.},

abstract = {Maize is a staple food for most households in Kenya and is grown in almost all agro-ecological zones. In the moist mid-altitude zone of western Kenya, which is drought prone and Striga weed infested, on-farm maize yield is too low to keep up with the rate of population growth, leading to serious food insecurity and poverty. The low yield is associated with low adoption of productivity improving technologies such as improved seed, which many farmers believe is inappropriate. The objectives of this study were to determine maize varieties farmers grow, farmers' preferences in choice of the varieties and to evaluate farmers' perceptions of constraints to maize production, on which basis research strategies for improvement of maize production could be formulated. The study, which was conducted in 5 villages sampled from 3 Districts, involved 8 focus group discussions composed of 83 male and 60 female farmers and interviews of individual key informants using a checklist. Scoring and ranking techniques were used to assess farmers' preferences and constraints. Nearly 80{\%} of the farmers predominantly grow local maize varieties, whose seed they recycle for many seasons, whilst about 20{\%} grow improved varieties, often in addition to the local varieties. The key farmers' criteria for variety selection, in order of importance, are high yield, early maturity, tolerance to stresses especially Striga, drought and insect pests, low costs of acquiring seed, and ability of a variety to give reasonable yield without application of external inputs, especially fertilizers and pesticides. The main constraints to maize production are low soil fertility, poor cash flows, market failures and pests. Striga is considered the most important pest, followed by weevils and stem borer. For increased maize production, research scientists should take into consideration the farmers' circumstances and develop appropriate maize varieties and crop management packages in order to increase likelihood of the technology adoption. This study shows how an interdisciplinary team of KARI and CIMMYT scientists involved farmers not only as end-users of maize technologies, but also as},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers in East-Africa commonly intercrop maize (Zea mays L.) with grain legumes to maximize utilisation of land and labour, and attain larger crop yields. Conventionally, one legume line is intercropped between each pair of maize lines. This study evaluated the potential of a modified two-by-two staggered arrangement (MBILI) to increase crop yields and economic benefits in two sites in Central Kenya with contrasting soil fertility levels during 7 consecutive seasons. Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) were grown as legume intercrops. The MBILI system resulted in increased maize yields in both sites, and increased cowpea yields in the poor site. In the fertile site, using beans as an intercrop was most profitable, and the MBILI system increased net benefits by 40{\%}, relative to the conventional system. In the poor site, groundnut and cowpea were better adapted, and the MBILI system increased net benefit by 12-37{\%}. Positive effects of the MBILI system were most pronounced in the poor site, but occurred independent of soil fertility level. Rainfall amounts and distribution varied widely, but the MBILI system increased yields both under conditions of ample and inadequate rainfall. N balances were negative with beans and groundnut, but neutral with cowpea as the intercrop. A modest N fertilizer application is therefore essential to sustain yields in the long term, especially when beans or groundnuts are intercropped. In conclusion, the MBILI system, when combined with adjusted nutrient inputs, resulted in superior and robust improvements in crop yields and economic benefits, relative to the conventional intercropping system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Access, efficiency and affordability of agricultural information continue to be a major impediment for raising agricultural productivity among smallholders in Africa. Recently information and communication technology (ICT) has provided a possible pathway to ameliorate this scenario. A variety of innovations that integrate ICTs into the dissemination of agricultural information to farmers (Farmers Information Services –FIS) have been developed at local, national and regional levels. They have currently demonstrated a promising field of new research and application in e-agriculture whilst bringing new sources of information and new tools for local knowledge dissemination. This paper reviews and discusses the role of ICT and its practical contributions to agriculture and rural development in Kenya. Data from various sources- Kenya's agricultural departments, ICT providers, NGOs and grey literature reviews were used. Results indicate use of ICTs especially mobile telephones is currently widespread in the rural areas of Kenya. Approximately one member of smallholder farming households own mobile phones. Extension service providers have harnessed this technology by putting it into profitable use in rural Kenya. For example, Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange (KACE) has developed a short messaging service- SMS SOKONI in partnership with Safaricom mobile phone provider. Any farmer anywhere in the country can access updated and reliable market information on prices and commodity offers at an affordable rate using their mobile phones. So far, the service is easy to use, reliable, convenient and affordable. The average monthly usage of this service increased from 1,273 in 2006 to 24,716 in 2008, demonstrating its subsequent usefulness and eagerness of farmers to explore the market information and linkage systems. Farmers are also able to access information on the right Hybrid Maize seeds to plant in their respective agro- ecological zones by way of texting to Kenya Seed Company Ltd a major seed distributor in East African region.This paper recommends adoption of such technologies by institutions such as Metrological Department to enhance provision of updated data on climate for appropriate decision making by agricultural farmers.

abstract = {Although many Decision Support Systems (DSSs) have been developed for crop management, DSSs have contributed little to practical agriculture because of the so-called 'problem of implementation'; under-utilisation has been ascribed to both technical limitations of the DSSs and to farmer attitude towards DSSs. A new DSS, named vite.net{\textregistered}, was developed for sustainable management of vineyards and is intended for the vineyard manager (the person who makes decisions about the vineyard management or suggests the proper actions to the grape-grower). The DSS has two main parts: (i) an integrated system for real-time monitoring of the vineyard components (air, soil, plants, pests, and diseases) and (ii) a web-based tool that analyses these data by using advanced modelling techniques and then provides up-to-date information for managing the vineyard in the form of alerts and decision supports. The information is tailored to a vineyard, or part of a vineyard, or a number of vineyards that are uniformly managed throughout the season. In the design and development of vite.net{\textregistered}, the implementation problem was specifically addressed by: (i) focusing on the important vineyard problems with a holistic approach (the DSS incorporates overall management solutions for growers); (ii) using automation and integration in data collection, and supporting flexible input efforts by the user; (iii) developing and validating fit-to-purpose, mechanistic, dynamic models; (iv) designing a user-friendly interface and providing complete and easy-to-understand information; (v) delivering the DSS through the Web and thereby enabling both continuous updating by the provider and flexible access by the user; (vi) designing the DSS with the goal of assisting the decision maker (by providing necessary information) rather than replacing the decision maker; (vii) involving potential users during vite.net{\textregistered} development and testing so as to obtain insight into how users make decisions; (viii) communicating the benefits of the DSS via seminars and visits to demonstration vineyards; (ix) involving chemical companies and other potential stakeholders; and (x) developing a two-way communication mode with the end-users, i.e., by combining "push" and "pull" systems. Feedback collected during development, testing, and practical use of vite.net{\textregistered} suggested that potential users were likely to use the DSS and that the 'implementation problem' had been successfully addressed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sampling and analysis or visual examination of soil to assess its status and use potential is widely practiced from plot to national scales. However, the choice of relevant soil attributes and interpretation of measurements are not straightforward, because of the complexity and site-specificity of soils, legacy effects of previous land use, and trade-offs between ecosystem services. Here we review soil quality and related concepts, in terms of definition, assessment approaches, and indicator selection and interpretation. We identify the most frequently used soil quality indicators under agricultural land use. We find that explicit evaluation of soil quality with respect to specific soil threats, soil functions and ecosystem services has rarely been implemented, and few approaches provide clear interpretation schemes of measured indicator values. This limits their adoption by land managers as well as policy. We also consider novel indicators that address currently neglected though important soil properties and processes, and we list the crucial steps in the development of a soil quality assessment procedure that is scientifically sound and supports management and policy decisions that account for the multi-functionality of soil. This requires the involvement of the pertinent actors, stakeholders and end-users to a much larger degree than practiced to date.},

abstract = {Functional trait-based ecological research has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of natural plant community dynamics. However, to date, principles of functional trait ecology have not been widely applied to agricultural research and management. Here, we discuss why and how a functional trait approach - distinct from a traditional agronomic trait approach that focuses strictly on crop yield components - can provide a valuable framework for agricultural research. We illustrate these points with an emphasis on commodity crops. The literature suggests a key role for functional trait-based research in understanding the causes and consequences of changes in agroecosystem structure and function. This includes novel approaches to understanding crop breeding and productivity, agroecosystem dynamics and non-crop biodiversity maintenance, the contributions of agroecosystems to global net primary productivity and other biogeochemical cycles, and agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We propose that a key step in advancing trait-based agricultural research is the consolidation of functional trait data for the world's most common crop and fodder species, the main commodities on ∼1{\textperiodcentered}2 billion ha of land. Using Coffea arabica as an example, we show there is strong potential to populate a comprehensive data base of crop functional trait data. For C. arabica, there exist hundreds of observations for ecologically important 'leaf economics' and 'root economics' traits, either in smaller data bases or peer-reviewed studies, but these have not been consolidated. A similar opportunity for functional trait data consolidation exists for many of the world's most common crops. Synthesis and applications. A unified functional trait data base for just 65 of the world's most common agricultural crops can be used to provide baseline evaluations of the functional diversity across croplands covering ∼8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} of the Earth's land surface. This functional trait data, and other trait-based research, could further be used to evaluate how changes in interspecific and intraspecific crop diversity are mechanistically linked with alterations in agroecosystem function. Ultimately, trait-based research that examines the causes and consequences of agricultural homogenization may contribute to more ecologically informed management of agricultural diversity, from genetic through to global scales.

abstract = {A poor response to fertilizer application is one of the persisting constraints preventing closure of the maize yield gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is speculated that nutrient imbalances derived from deficient and/or excessive concentrations could be one of the causes of this limited response of maize to fertilizer. This is however not confirmed and the extent of such poor response is ill-documented. To investigate this, we conducted 44 on-farm trials with a two treatment structure (with and without NPK fertilizer) in two subsequent seasons, the 2014 long rains (LR) and short rains (SR) distributed across two sites: Bungoma-Southwest and Busia-North in western Kenya. As a discriminating criterion between responsive and poorly responsive soils, we used a Value Cost Ratio (VCR) of 2 of NPK fertilizer use. Nutrient sufficiency ranges were developed using compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND method) and then used to identify both deficient and/or excessive nutrient concentrations occurring in maize grown in the poorly responsive soils. Results show that 48{\%} of all fields from both sites could be classified as ‘poorly responsive', with small VCR values ranging between 0.1 and 1.99. Nutrient deficiencies were more prevalent than situations of excessive concentrations in such fields. N-deficiency was the most common in the unfertilized (control) plots occurring in between 80 and 89{\%} of the poorly responsive plots. Zn-deficiency became apparent in the fertilized plots and was observed at similar frequencies in this treatment. The next most widespread nutrient deficiencies in poorly responsive soils were those of P and Cu affecting between 70 and 79{\%} of both control and fertilized plots. K and Mg deficiencies were rare in both treatments. This study indicates that the occurrence of poorly responsive soils in Bungoma-southwest and Busia-North is likely related to micronutrient deficiencies. These findings necessitate further investigation on the bioavailability of these micronutrients nutrients in such soils and a validation trial to evaluate the extent of crop responses.},

abstract = {Baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) is a multipurpose, drought resistant, wild fruit tree, endemic to arid and semi-arid lands of Sub-Saharan Africa. Baobab populations have been showing a lack of regeneration, and therefore causes concern for the species survival. This study investigated the state, distribution and use of baobabs in an under-researched population in Kenya, to identify the potential for further use and development of baobab resources. A baobab population was chosen in Taita–Taveta County, covering a sample area of 2015 km2. A systematic stratified transect survey was done to map baobab distribution using 49 transects (0.5 × 3 km each). The diameter at breast height and other indicators were measured on all baobabs in the transects to assess population status and health. A household survey (n = 46) and focus group discussions (n = 12) were done following the transect survey to gain an idea on the uses and distribution of baobab. In total, 432 baobab trees were measured and recorded in the research area of 2015 km2. The baobabs grew in two clusters (i.e., areas with a baobab density of ≥0.08 baobabs/ha). Both clusters showed rejuvenating populations. The main factors identified by the respondents, positively and negatively influencing baobab distribution were environmental factors, wildlife, human impact and commercial value. The study area shows a great potential for baobab to become an important part of the diet, due to its current use as an emergency food during food scarce times, and the relatively healthy and stable rejuvenating populations.},

abstract = {Characterization of smallholder farmers has been conducted in various researches by using machine learning algorithms, participatory and expert-based methods. All approaches used end up with the development of some subgroups known as farm typologies. The main purpose of this paper is to highlight the main approaches used to characterize smallholder farmers, presenting the pros and cons of the approaches. By understanding the nature and key advantages of the reviewed approaches, the paper recommends a hybrid approach towards having predictive farm typologies. Search of relevant research articles published between 2007 and 2018 was done on ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. By using a generated search query, 20 research articles related to characterization of smallholder farmers were retained. Cluster-based algorithms appeared to be the mostly used in characterizing smallholder farmers. However, being highly unpredictable and inconsistent, use of clustering methods calls in for a discussion on how well the developed farm typologies can be used to predict future trends of the farmers. A thorough discussion is presented and recommends use of supervised models to validate unsupervised models. In order to achieve predictive farm typologies, three stages in characterization are recommended as tested in smallholder dairy farmers datasets: (a) develop farm types from a comparative analysis of more than two unsupervised learning algorithms by using training models, (b) assess the training models' robustness in predicting farm types for a testing dataset, and (c) assess the predictive power of the developed farm types from each algorithm by predicting the trend of several response variables.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the biophysical and socioeconomic impacts of climate change on maize production and food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using adapted improved maize varieties and well-calibrated and validated bioeconomic models. Design/methodology/approach - Using the past climate (1950-2000) as a baseline, the study estimated the biophysical impacts of climate change in 2050 (2040-2069) and 2080 (2070-2099) under the A1B emission scenario and three nitrogen levels, and the socioeconomic impacts in 2050. Findings - Climate change will affect maize yields across SSA in 2050 and 2080, and the extent of the impact at a given period will vary considerably between input levels, regions and maize mega environments (MMEs). Greater relative yield reductions may occur under medium and high-input intensification than under low intensification, in Western and Southern Africa than in Eastern and Central Africa and in lowland and dry mid-altitude than in highland and wet mid-altitude MMEs. Climate change may worsen food insecurity in SSA in 2050 through its negative impact on maize consumption and reduction in daily calorie intake. However, international trade has the potential to offset some of the negative impacts. Originality/value - The study calibrated and applied bioeconomic models to estimate the biophysical and socioeconomic impact of climate change on maize production at fine resolution.The results could be used as a baseline to evaluate measures that will be applied to adapt maize to the future climate in SSA.},

abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

abstract = {The improved grain yield per unit area of modern maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids is due to the increased optimum plant population rather than the improved grain yield per plant. Traits associated with tolerance to various stresses, including high plant populations, and the efficiency of capture and use of resources rendered modern hybrids more productive. As a consequence of the improved tolerance to high plant populations and the low yield potential per plant, modern hybrids are strongly population-dependent as their maximum grain yield is achieved only under a narrow spectrum of high plant populations, followed by adverse effects on hybrids' productivity and stability. Missing plants and unevenness in the plant emergence constitute common problems in the field. Grain yield loss due to missing plants is poorly compensated by the increased yield of the surrounding plants, so grain yield per unit area decreases. Unevenness in the plant emergence leads to increased plant-to-plant variability, the impact being stronger under higher plant populations. Plant-to-plant variability is associated with decreased resource use efficiency, and therefore with reduced grain yield. At higher plant populations reduced grain yield also results from the increased pollen-to-silking interval and the following barrenness. Consequently, maize breeding should seek hybrids that combine population-tolerance and improved yield potential per plant, so that a wider range of optimum plant populations insure both high productivity and stable performance. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There are numerous examples of technologies with great potential that have not been accepted by smallholder farmers. Quite often, these technologies do not fit well into smallholder systems due to the inherent high level of heterogeneity of these systems. For example, despite their great potential, the adoption of legumes by smallholder farmers in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa has remained poor. A wide range of biophysical (e.g. climate, soil fertility, etc.) and socio-economic variables (e.g. preferences, prices, production objectives etc.) influence the use of legumes in smallholder systems. While some of these variables constrain the adoption of some legumes, others offer opportunities for beneficial use of other legumes in the same system. Therefore, widespread adoption of legumes in smallholder systems can only be achieved if all of the major biophysical and socio-economic constraints are simultaneously identified and addressed. The ‘socio-ecological niche' concept proposed in this paper provides the framework through which this might be achieved. The socio-ecological niche, in any given region of agricultural activity, is created by the convergence of agro-ecological, socio-cultural, economic and ecological factors, to describe a multidimensional environment for which compatible technologies can be predicted. The socio-ecological niche concept can be applied in many different contexts in technology development. However, this paper discusses its use with respect to the development of legume technologies. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the concept and to demonstrate its practical significance. The concept is being used in on-going research on legumes in smallholder farming systems in western Kenya. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Strong gradients of decreasing soil fertility are found with increasing distance from the homestead within smallholder African farms, due to differential resource allocation. As nutrient use efficiency varies strongly along these gradients, such heterogeneity must be considered when designing soil management strategies, aimed at an improved overall resource use efficiency at farm scale. Here, we quantify the magnitude and study the origin of farmer-induced, within-farm soil fertility gradients as affected by biophysical and socio-economic conditions, and investigate farmers' perceptions of such heterogeneity. Farm transects, participatory resource flow mapping, farmers' classification of land qualities, and soil sampling for both chemical and spectral reflectance analyses were performed across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka) representing the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Differences between the various field types of a farm were observed for input use (e.g. 0.7-104 kg N ha-1), food production (e.g. 0.6-2.9 t DM ha-1), partial C (e.g. -570 to 1480 kg ha-1) and N (e.g. -92 to 57 kg ha-1) balances and general soil fertility status, despite strong differences across sub-locations. Concentration of nutrients in the home fields compared with the remote fields were verified for extractable P (e.g. 2.1-19.8 mg kg-1) and secondarily for exchangeable K (e.g. 0.14-0.54 cmol(+) kg -1), on average, whereas differences for soil C and N were only important when considering each individual farm separately. Farmers managed their fields according to their perceived land quality, varying the timing and intensity of management practices along soil fertility gradients. Fields classified by them as poor were planted later (up to 33.6 days of delay), with sparser crops (ca. 30{\%} less plants m-2) and had higher weed infestation levels than those classified as fertile, leading to important differences in maize yield (e.g. 0.9 versus 2.4 t ha-1). The internal heterogeneity in resource allocation varied also between farms of different social classes, according to their objectives and factor constraints. Additionally, the interaction of sub-location-specific socio-economic (population, markets) and biophysical factors (soilscape variability) determined the patterns of resource allocation to different activities. Such interactions need to be considered for the characterisation of farming system to facilitate targeting research and development interventions to address the problem of poor soil fertility. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), maize production is not only constrained by the limited use of P fertilisers, but also by the strong P fixation (on Fe- and Al-oxides) which consequently lowers the amount of bioavailable P in the soil solution. We hypothesise that substitution of triple super phosphate (TSP) fertiliser with farmyard manure (FYM) and its localised application in the planting row increases the agronomic use efficiency (AE) of the P fertiliser applied. Field experiments were conducted during the 2009 long rains (LRs) and short rains (SRs) at three sites (Sega, Bokoli and Teso) located in western Kenya, to assess (i) the effect of concentrating FYM in different areas of the planting rows, (ii) FYM and TSP applications at different substitution rates and (iii) the effect of FYM and TSP additions and/or their combinations on soil pH, available P, maize yields, AE and economic benefits. Treatments included substituting TSP by FYM at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100{\%} of the 26kgPha-1 recommended rate. Further, 13kgPha-1 FYM was either applied to 100{\%} of planting area (i.e. broadcast) or localised in only 50{\%} or 25{\%}, of the planting area of the maize row. Results show that FYM and TSP combinations increased maize grain yields by over 200{\%} in Sega, 90-150{\%} in Teso and 20-50{\%} in Bokoli relative to the control. The AE largely depended on the relative fertility of the soils but increased with an increase in FYM in the substitutions. Soil pH and available P were improved by FYM applications only in the second season (2009 SRs). Maximising P from FYM in the substitutions increased net benefits by over 33{\%} with gross benefit cost ratios{\textgreater}4.5{\$}{\$}-1 relative to sole TSP application at 26kgPha-1. Concentrating FYM in 25{\%} of the planting area gave over 32{\%} increases in net benefits relative to broadcast. This study confirms that it is possible to reduce the quantity of FYM if it is applied only in the planting row but its profitability largely depends on the quality of the material selected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Tokatlidis2017,
abstract = {Competition between crop plants, due to resource limitation, is at the root of a considerable yield limitation, a major problem that future agriculture is faced with. Due to inter-plant variation, intra-crop competition causes plant-to-plant interference and unbalanced use of input which decreases possible profit. Acquired intra-crop competition is a priori present in farming due to spatial heterogeneity. Genetically imposed intra-crop competition is due to the plant-to-plant genetic differences, i.e. the intra-species genetic competition in multi-genotypic varieties grown alone, and both the intra- and inter-species genetic competition in intercropping multi-genotypic varieties. In general, high densities accelerate the acquired plant-to-plant variation and intensify the intra-crop competition. Considering environmental diversity, an additional yield gap element is density-reliance. Density-reliant varieties are inefficient in resource use at the single-plant level and present poor results at low densities, accompanied by variation in optimum density particularly in rain-fed agroecosystems. The remedy relies on breeding of varieties that comprise the ‘weak competitor' ideotype(s) of improved plant yield efficiency in order to mitigate the intra-crop variation and optimise the resource use across variable conditions. To focus on both, selection at nil-competition (widely spaced plants to preclude interference for inputs) is necessary. Selection among spaced plants is further supported by the negative relationship between genotype competitive and yielding ability. The derived density-independent varieties would be capable of taking advantage of the abundance of resources in favourable seasons at low densities that are suitable for dry seasons, approaching the attainable yield across locations and seasons.},

abstract = {The fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) estimated that by 2040 agroforestry would offer high potential of carbon (C) sequestration in developing countries. However, the role of tropical agroforestry in C sequestration and in climate change mitigation has only recently been recognized by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is partly due to the lack of reliable estimates on the sequestration potential in biomass and soil carbon pools over time. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in the biomass and soil carbon pools of three indigenous agroforestry systems in south-eastern Rift Valley escrapment of Ethiopia using CO2FIX (v. 3.2) model. The agroforestry systems studied were Enset (Ensete ventricosum)-tree, Enset-coffee-tree, and Tree-coffee systems. To run the model, empirical data collected from 60 farms (20 farms for each agroforestry system) and literature were used as inputs to parameterize the model. Simulations were run over a period of 50 years. Average simulated total biomass C stocks was the highest for Tree-coffee system (122Mg Cha-1), followed by the Enset-coffee-tree (114Mg Cha-1) and Enset-tree system (76Mg Cha-1). The tree cohort accounted for 89-97{\%} of the total biomass C stocks in all the studied systems, and the reminder was shared by Enset and coffee cohorts. The total average simulated total C stocks (biomass and soil) were 209, 286 and 301Mg Cha-1 for Enset-tree, Enset-coffee-tree and Tree-coffee systems, respectively. The soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks accounted for 60-64{\%} of the total carbon in the studied systems. Model validation results showed that long-term (10-40 years) simulated biomass C stocks were within the range of measured biomass C stocks for Enset-tree and Enset-coffee-tree systems, but significantly differed for the Tree-coffee system. The simulated soil and total C stocks were within the range of measured values for all the three systems. The CO2FIX model accurately predicted the SOC and total C stocks in the studied indigenous agroforestry systems, but the prediction of the biomass C stocks could be improved by acquiring more accurate input parameter values for running the model.},

abstract = {Agroforestry has large potential for carbon (C) sequestration while providing many economical, social, and ecological benefits via its diversified products. Airborne lidar is considered as the most accurate technology for mapping aboveground biomass (AGB) over landscape levels. However, little research in the past has been done to study AGB of agroforestry systems using airborne lidar data. Focusing on an agroforestry system in the Brazilian Amazon, this study first predicted plot-level AGB using fixed-effects regression models that assumed the regression coefficients to be constants. The model prediction errors were then analyzed from the perspectives of tree DBH (diameter at breast height)-height relationships and plot-level wood density, which suggested the need for stratifying agroforestry fields to improve plot-level AGB modeling. We separated teak plantations from other agroforestry types and predicted AGB using mixed-effects models that can incorporate the variation of AGB-height relationship across agroforestry types. We found that, at the plot scale, mixed-effects models led to better model prediction performance (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) than the fixed-effects models, with the coefficient of determination (R2) increasing from 0.38 to 0.64. At the landscape level, the difference between AGB densities from the two types of models was {\~{}}10{\%} on average and up to {\~{}}30{\%} at the pixel level. This study suggested the importance of stratification based on tree AGB allometry and the utility of mixed-effects models in modeling and mapping AGB of agroforestry systems.},

abstract = {Aim: Traditional African vegetables have high potential to contribute to healthy diets and climate resilience in sub-Saharan African food systems. However, their genetic resources are likely at threat because they are underutilized and under the radar of agricultural research. This paper aims to contribute to a conservation agenda for traditional African vegetables by examining the geographical diversity and conservation status of these species. Location: Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: 126 traditional annual and perennial African vegetables were selected for their food and nutrition potential. Food uses and species' areas of origin were recorded from literature. Species' presence records were collected from open-access databases of genebanks and herbaria. These records were used to determine geographical patterns of observed and modelled richness, to distinguish geographical clusters with different compositions of vegetables, to assess species' ex situ and in situ conservation status and to prioritize countries for conservation actions. Results: Of the 126 species, 79 originated in sub-Saharan Africa. High levels of observed and modelled species richness were found in: (a) West Tropical Africa in Ghana, Togo and Benin; (b) West-Central Tropical Africa in South Cameroon; (c) Northeast and East Tropical Africa in Ethiopia and Tanzania; and (d) Southern Africa in Eswatini. South Sudan, Angola and DR Congo are potential areas of high species richness that require further exploration. In general, ex situ conservation status of the selected species was poor compared to their in situ conservation status. Main conclusions: Areas of high species richness in West Tropical Africa, South Cameroon and Ethiopia coincide with centres of crop domestication and cultural diversity. Hotspots of diversity in Tanzania and Eswatini are especially rich in wild vegetables. Addressing the conservation of vegetable diversity in West Tropical Africa and South Cameroon is of most urgent concern as vegetable genetic resources from these locations are least represented in ex situ collections.},

By mid-century, the mean estimates of aggregate production changes in SSA under our preferred model specification are - 22, - 17, - 17, - 18, and - 8{\%} for maize, sorghum, millet, groundnut, and cassava, respectively. In all cases except cassava, there is a 95{\%} probability that damages exceed 7{\%}, and a 5{\%} probability that they exceed 27{\%}.

abstract = {Agricultural extension services the world over have been instrumental in ensuring agriculturists stay abreast of new developments to improve their productivity and economic livelihoods. This historical study describes the origin and practice of agricultural extension in the former British colonies of Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Kenya before their independence and during the decades afterward, and identifies some of the challenges impacting extension services in these countries. Over time, in a bid to improve their agricultural sectors, these countries employed a number of approaches to providing extension/advisory services. Some methods, however, were coercive and little more than the enforcement of laws and customs prejudicial to the nations' Black farmers. This often resulted in cruel treatment, exploitation, and oppression of these farmers, especially during the colonial era. In the post-colonial era, no single approach to extension delivery has been without shortcomings (Davis, 2008). To that end, a pluralistic paradigm has shown promise in mitigating the limitations of any single approach. Additional research should be conducted to determine the longstanding impact of using chiefs and other law enforcers as extension agents on individuals' present-day perceptions about extension and its potential for meeting the needs of smallholder, resource-poor farmers in the future.},

abstract = {Maize is the major food crop in Kenya, where 2.3 million tonnes are produced annually to feed an estimated 28.6 million people (79 kg/person p.a.). Population growth in the country is high (2.9{\%} p.a.), resulting in increased pressure on arable land and, consequently, increased pest pressure on crops. Stemborers are one of the most important pests of maize. Previous research with artificial infestation established clear links between damage factors and yield losses. These results, however, cannot be extrapolated to estimate crop losses in farmers' fields under natural infestation. Due to lack of field data, farmers' (often subjective) estimates of losses under natural infestation and the incidence of infestation were used to estimate maize yield losses for each of Kenya's major agroecological zones. The yield loss was estimated to be 12.9{\%}, amounting to 0.39 million tonnes of maize, with an estimated value of US{\$} 76 million. High-potential areas have relatively low crop loss levels (10-12{\%}), while the low-potential areas have higher losses (15-21{\%}). Taking into account the higher yield of the former areas (more than 2.5 t/ha), the loss per hectare is remarkably constant, between 315 and 374 kg/ha, except for the dry mid-altitude zones, where losses total approximately 175 kg/ha. The value of these losses is estimated at US{\$} 61-75/ha and US{\$} 34/ha, respectively. Such estimates are useful for setting research and extension priorities. {\textcopyright} 2002 ICIPE.},

abstract = {The difficult question of which variables to include as a minimum data set of soil quality (SQ) indicators may be simplified by statistical methods, which allow working with databases including categorical and numerical variables commonly used for assessing SQ. The aims of this study were: i) to identify soil structural related parameters that may associate to SQ at different geographic areas and ii) to test the potential power of using decision trees in setting up a framework for SQ assessment, and in determining structural soil properties, visually evaluated, that could be included in the estimation of soil physical properties such as saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). SQ was evaluated by visual soil assessment (VSA) in the field and a limited number of physical and chemical soil properties (bulk density (BD), air capacity, plant available water capacity (PAWC), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), water stable aggregates (WSA), particle size distribution, soil organic carbon (SOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC)) determined in the laboratory. Using categorical and numerical data of those physical, chemical and morphological properties of soils in both tropical and temperate areas, classification trees and model trees were grown. Parameters related to SQ differed between geographic areas. Ks was the strongest variable determining the SQ in 'tropical' soils, but WSA, SOC and PAWC were also key variables in determining differences in SQ. For 'temperate' soils PAWC was the only variable selected by the tree building algorithm. SOC, clay, and CEC were the discriminating variables of the model constructed from the combined data set. Statistically significant relationships between measured and visual parameters are promising in demonstrating the SQ description required for merging morphological, physical and chemical properties for minimum data set of SQ indicators. Thresholds of different predicting variables could be better established when SQ frameworks involve VSA. We also proved that prediction of KS with a model tree was more accurate when morphological parameters were included as predictor variables, and that in that case the model tree showed a simpler structure compared to the tree built only from chemical and physical soil properties. In conclusion, decision trees are encouraging in the selection of SQ indicators. Moreover, including morphological properties in the prediction of key soil properties such as Ks seems promising. VSA could render morphological response variables for predicting other soil properties and developing SQ frameworks (agricultural interest) more capable of representing structural dynamic. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper offers an overview of how climate change is already affecting farmers across eastern and southern Africa, and how it will continue to affect them in the future. The rising temperatures and increased rainfall variability associated with climate change are undermining the livelihoods and food security of Africa's farmers, most of whom work at a subsistence level and also face problems of poverty, inadequate infrastructure and poor governance. To address these problems, governments and development organizations have promoted climate-smart agriculture (CSA). These projects, however, have been constrained by inadequate data and predictions regarding future climate change. In particular, farmers in Africa need better projections of the climate hazards for specific regions. Historical weather data at the local level contains many gaps, and the continuing collection of such data could be much improved. Strengthening the database of observed weather is critical to understanding the changes that have occurred already, to project future changes, and to plan appropriately to address them. Once collected and analyzed, climate data must be communicated in ways that help decision-makers understand climate impacts. Good tools are available---such as ClimateWizard.org and Servir ClimateServ---but practitioners at the local level must have the access and training to use them. Even in places where projections are uncertain, steps can be taken now to implement CSA practices and make farmers more resilient in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {1. We review the effects of root and shoot competition on plant biomass by meta-analysis of 38 published studies, each reporting on the factorial effects of root-competition and shoot-competition on herbaceous plants. 2. There were significant differences in the overall effects of root, shoot and full competition. Root competition generally resulted in larger biomass reduction than shoot competition, particularly among the smaller of the two competitors. An interaction between root and shoot competition was observed in some experiments but was generally not significant. 3. While root competition was generally stronger than shoot competition at lower nutrient levels, there was no overall difference at higher nutrient levels due to much lower levels of root competition. In contrast, the overall effect of full competition increased considerably with nutrient level. 4. Root competition was generally more important when the neighbour was a grass as compared with a herb or a legume, and when domesticated plants competed with wild neighbours, suggesting that wild genotypes are stronger competitors for below-ground resources than are crop plants. 5. Effects of competition were generally stronger in experiments with additive designs than in those with substitutive designs. Also, experiments using single target individuals showed stronger effects of competition, root competition in particular, than did experiments using groups targets. 6. Synthesis. Despite large variation among experiments, some general patterns were supported: effects of root competition are generally stronger than shoot competition, particularly (i) for smaller competitors, (ii) at low fertility levels, (iii) when the competitor is a grass rather than an herb, (iv) when the competitor is a wild rather than a domesticated species, and (v) in additive design experiments. The effects of root and shoot competition appear to be additive under many conditions. Whereas root competition may often be the primary limitation on mean plant performance, shoot competition will influence the variation around this mean and may determine which individuals or species dominate.},

abstract = {Agricultural technologies are seen as an important route out of poverty in most of the developing countries. However the rate of adoption of these technologies has remained low in most of these countries. This study aim at shedding some light on the potential factors that influence agricultural technology adoption in developing countries. It does so by reviewing previous studies done on technology adoption. From the study technological, economic, institutional factors and human specific factors are found to be the determinants of agricultural technology adoption. The study recommend the future studies on adoption to widen the range of variables used by including perception of farmers towards new technology. Introduction Agriculture plays an important role in economic growth, enhancing food security, poverty reduction and rural development. It is the main source of income for around 2.5 billion people in the developing world (FAO, 2003). Smallholder agriculture is identified as a vital development tool for achieving Millennium Development Goals, one of which is to halve the people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 (World Bank, 2008). However majority of smallholder farmers relies on traditional methods of production and this has lowered the level of productivity. For instance Over 70{\%} of the maize production in the majority of developing countries is from smallholders who use traditional methods of production (Muzari et al., 2012). These farmers generally obtain very low crop yields because the local varieties used by farmers have low potential yield, most of the maize is grown under rain-fed conditions and irrigation is used only in limited areas, little or no fertilizers are used and pest control is not adequate (Muzari et al., 2012; Shao, 1996). This has triggered much of discussion on the need to increase productivity and sustainability in agriculture globally but much less information is available on specific means to achieve this aim. Increasing agricultural productivity is critical to meet expected rising demand and, as such, it is instructive to examine recent performance in cases of modern agricultural technologies (Challa, 2013). Agricultural technologies include all kinds of improved techniques and practices which affect the growth of agricultural output (Jain et al., 2009). According to Loevinsohn et al. (2013) the most common areas of technology development and promotion for crops include new varieties and management regimes; soil as well as soil fertility management; weed and pest management; irrigation and water management. By virtue of improved input/output relationships, new technology tends to raise output and reduces average cost of production which in turn results in substantial gains in farm income (Challa, 2013). Adopters of improved technologies increase their productions, leading to constant socio-economic development. Adoption of improved agricultural technologies has been associated with: higher earnings and lower poverty; improved nutritional status; lower staple food prices; increased employment opportunities as well as earnings for landless laborers (Kasirye, 2010). Adoption of improved technologies is believed to be a major factor in the success of the green revolution experienced by Asian countries (Ravallion and Chen, 2004; Kasirye, 2010).On the other hand, non-adopters can hardly maintain their marginal livelihood with socio-economic stagnation leading to deprivation (Jain et al., 2009). A new agricultural technology that enhances sustainable production of food and fiber is therefore critical for sustainable food security and economic development. This has made the dynamics of technical change in agriculture to be an area of intense research since the early part of twentieth century (Loevinsohn et al., 2013). These technologies are particularly relevant to smallholder farmers in developing countries because they are constrained in many ways, which makes them a priority for development efforts. These farmers for instance, live and farm in areas where rainfall is low and erratic, and soils tend to be infertile. In addition, infrastructure and},

abstract = {Conservation agriculture through the use of crop residue retention and no-tillage (NT) has been widely practiced to improve agricultural soil quality, such as to increase soil organic carbon (C) content and the microbial population size. However, there has been no quantitative analysis on the effect of conservation agriculture, particularly in relation to crop residue retention, on soil microbial biomass C (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic), and the microbial quotient (qMIC, Cmic-to-organic C ratio), which are frequently used as indicators of soil health under different agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of conservation agriculture practices on soil Cmic, Nmic and qMIC on a global scale using meta-analysis based on data from 96 recent publications. Relative to conventional tillage (CT) without residue retention, NT without residue retention (NTR0) increased Cmic by 33{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05), while NT with residue retention (NTR) increased (P {\textless} 0.05) Cmic, Nmic, and qMIC by 25, 64, and 57{\%}, respectively. Greater Cmic and Nmic were found in the NT than in the CT treatment, regardless of the soil condition (e.g., soil pH and texture), experimental duration, and climate (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation). Particularly, NTR was a promising conservation agriculture practice to increase Cmic and Nmic in global farmlands, and NTR0 can be an alternate strategy for loam soils in the subhumid (600–1000 mm mean annual precipitation) region, or under long-term ({\textgreater}20 yr) conservation agriculture practices. We conclude that NTR should be an important strategy that could be used to increase Cmic and Nmic contents and improve soil quality in global farmlands.},

abstract = {Fertilizers play a significant role in securing the production of food crops around the world. In fact, it is estimated that fertilizers currently support 40-60{\%} of all crop production currently. Meeting future food security targets requires the responsible use of fertilizer nutrients. The 4R Nutrient Stewardship guidelines were developed by the fertilizer industry as a process to guide fertilizer Best Management Practices (BMP) in all regions of the world. This approach was required to address the growing concern that fertilizers are applied indiscriminately to the detriment of the environment. Given that farmers purchase fertilizers at world prices in most regions, and these prices have been steadily increasing over time, most users are very cautious about the rates of nutrients they apply. To avoid unnecessary policy intervention by governments, the fertilizer industry needs to be unified in their promotion of BMPs that support improved nutrient use efficiency and environmental sustainability, while supporting the farmer's profitability. This ultimately comes down to developing appropriate recommendations that match crop nutrient requirements fertilizer additions and minimize nutrient losses from fields. This lead to the 4R Nutrient Stewardship concept, applying the Right Source of nutrients, at the Right Rate, at the Right Time and in the Right Place. Right source means matching the fertilizer to the crop need and soil properties. A major part of source is balance between the various nutrients, a major challenge globally in improving nutrient use efficiency. Finally, some fertilizer products are preferred to others based on the soil properties, like pH. Right rate means matching the fertilizer applied to the crop need - simple as that. However, this is far from being a simple concept when you consider the variations in yield goals, previous crop management, crop residue management, influence of legume crops in rotation, etc. Adding too much fertilizer leads to residual nutrients in the soil and losses to the environment. Ultimately, striking a balance between the crop needs, environmental conditions and the farmers economic situation is required. Right time means making fertilizer nutrients available to the crop when they are needed. Nutrient use efficiency can be increased significantly when their availability is synchronized with crop demand. Split time of application, slow and controlled release fertilizer technology, stabilizers and inhibitors are just a few examples of how fertilizer nutrients can be better timed for efficient crop uptake. Right place means making every effort to keep nutrients where crops can use them. This is an issue which poses the greatest challenge in small holder agricultural systems, where most fertilizer is broadcast applied, and in many cases without incorporation. Research indicates that fertilizer placement can not only improve crop response, but also improve fertilizer use efficiency significantly by lowering nutrient application rates. Adaptation to non-mechanized agriculture have been made in certain regions which clearly support efforts to modify fertilizer placement as a BMP.},

abstract = {The lack of high quality agroforestry tree germplasm has long been recognized as one of the major challenges to widespread adoption of agroforestry in Southern Africa. Productivity levels realized in operational scale plantings are far less than those demonstrated in research and this has been partly blamed on the use of germplasm of unknown quality and low productivity potential. The lack of high quality germplasm is attributable to the absence of regulations to govern its production in the countries promoting agroforestry. Most of the agroforestry tree germplasm is sold or distributed without regard to its genetic, physiological and physical quality. Given these challenges, in this paper, we reviewed crop seed certification in general and tree germplasm certification in the USA, Europe, India, Southern Africa and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with a view to find potential similarities with agroforestry tree germplasm. Only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Burkina Faso, Madagascar and Rwanda) were found to have tree germplasm certification: the OECD Forest Seed and Plant certification scheme. From the review, it is possible to establish agroforestry tree germplasm quality control systems, more so in countries that already have tree seed centres and tree seed regulations. A simple agroforestry tree germplasm certification scheme, based on the FAOs Quality Declared Seed (QDS) with truth-in-labelling is recommended. Three germplasm categories (audit, select and genetically improved) are recommended as a start. Furthermore, countries will need to develop new or amend existing agricultural seed policies and regulations to include agroforestry tree germplasm certification under QDS. Finally, germplasm quality standards for the selected agroforestry trees species in the respective countries will need to be developed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa face multiple trade-offs when deciding on the allocation of their financial, labour and nutrient resources. Day-to-day decisions have implications for the sustainability of their farming system, implying multiple trade-offs between short- and long-term objectives that have biophysical and socio-economic dimensions. We show that inverse modelling techniques can be used effectively for optimisation and trade-offs analysis of farming systems. By combining the multi-objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and a crop/soil dynamic simulation model we were able to select farming strategies that resulted in the best possible trade-offs between different farming objectives. This integrated analytical tool allows optimisation of farmers' goals similar to linear programming, but an advantage over linear programming is that the proposed method takes into account a wider spectrum of biophysical processes including their interactions and feedbacks. Tradeoffs between resource productivity, use efficiency and conservation in relation to different patterns of resource allocation were analysed for a maize-based, simplified case study farm from western Kenya (2.2 ha - comprising fields of poor, medium and high soil fertility), under three scenarios of financial liquidity to invest in labour and inputs (2000, 5000 and 10,000 KSh ha-1; 75 KSh = 1 US{\$}). The maximum farm-scale maize production achieved was larger when financial resources increased. However, increasing maize yields above a certain threshold by applying mineral fertilisers was associated with larger N losses by leaching, runoff and soil erosion; such threshold was 2.7 t grain ha-1 for the scenario of no financial limitations (10,000 KSh ha-1). N losses at farm scale fluctuated between 36 and 54 kg N ha-1 season-1, while the maximum maize yields achieved were around 3.4 t grain ha-1. Soil losses by erosion increased abruptly beyond a certain maize yield (e.g. 1.8 t grain ha-1 for the 2000 KSh ha-1 scenario), while the minimum rate of soil loss differed between financial scenarios. Investments in hiring labour were prioritised over fertiliser use to obtain the greatest yields and the allocation of available resources favoured the more fertile fields. This inverse modelling exercise allowed us to analyse trade-offs between different farmers' objectives and to compare potential resource allocation strategies to achieve them. The set of strategies to achieve different goals was more numerous and variable when the conditions were less conducive for farming. This questions the validity of the prevailing model of extension/communication, based on generalised recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Africa. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Khan2009,
abstract = {Smallholder farming systems in eastern Africa are characterized by cereal/edible legume intercrops in fields severely constrained by parasitic weed, Striga hermonthica, cereal stemborers and declining soil fertility. The push-pull technology concurrently addresses these constraints. It involves intercropping maize with stemborer repellent fodder legume, Desmodium spp. (push), with an attractant crop, Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum (pull), planted around this intercrop, thus making it difficult to interplant edible legumes. We assessed farmers' practice and perceptions on intercropping and willingness to integrate beans in their push-pull plots from a sample of 300 farmers in six districts in western Kenya. All the respondents traditionally intercropped maize with beans, planted either between the rows of maize, in the same holes with maize or in between maize plants within a row. The majority (92{\%}) were willing to integrate beans in their push-pull plots. We, therefore, evaluated effects of integrating beans in the maize-desmodium intercrops. Treatments comprised a maize monocrop, maize-bean intercrop and three maize-desmodium intercrops, two of which were integrated with beans, either in the same holes with maize or in between maize plants in a row (bean integration plots). On-farm trials were similarly established among 56 farmers in four districts in western Kenya to assess the two integration methods. S. hermonthica counts and stemborer damage to maize were significantly lower and maize yields significantly higher in the maize-desmodium and bean integration plots than in the other systems. Overall, integration of beans in the maize-desmodium intercrops and the planting arrangement did not compromise the S. hermonthica and stemborer control efficacy of desmodium. Integration of beans significantly increased labour and total variable costs, with these being significantly higher in plots with both crops in different holes than in the same hole. Total revenue, gross benefits and benefit cost ratios did not significantly differ between the bean integration and maize-desmodium intercrops. Furthermore, these parameters were for most part not affected by the planting arrangements, both on-station and on-farm. These results show that integration of beans in the maize-desmodium and indeed push-pull technology while guaranteeing an additional crop, a protein source, to the farmers does not compromise the observed benefits of the technology but yields same economic benefits. Where labour is easily available, farmers are, however, advised to plant maize and beans in separate holes to avoid the risk of competition for moisture and nutrients where these might be limiting. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Replacing coffee with cocoa and integrating trees in combined agroforestry systems to ameliorate abiotic stress are among the proposed alternatives to overcome this challenge. These two alternatives do not consider the vulnerability of cocoa and tree species commonly used in agroforestry plantations to future climate conditions. We assessed the suitability of these alternatives by identifying the potential changes in the distribution of coffee, cocoa and the 100 most common agroforestry trees found in Mesoamerica. Here we show that cocoa could potentially become an alternative in most of coffee vulnerable areas. Agroforestry with currently preferred tree species is highly vulnerable to future climate change. Transforming agroforestry systems by changing tree species composition may be the best approach to adapt most of the coffee and cocoa production areas. Our results stress the urgency for land use planning considering climate change effects and to assess new combinations of agroforestry species in coffee and cocoa plantations in Mesoamerica.},

abstract = {Technological interventions to address the problem of poor productivity of smallholder agricultural systems must be designed to target socially diverse and spatially heterogeneous farms and farming systems. This paper proposes a categorisation of household diversity based on a functional typology of livelihood strategies, and analyses the influence of such diversity on current soil fertility status and spatial variability on a sample of 250 randomly selected farms from six districts of Kenya and Uganda. In spite of the agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity observed across the region (e.g. 4 months year-1 of food self-sufficiency in Vihiga, Kenya vs. 10 in Tororo, Uganda) consistent patterns of variability were also observed. For example, all the households with less than 3 months year-1 of food self-sufficiency had a land:labour ratio (LLR) {\textless} 1, and all those with LLR {\textgreater} 1 produced enough food to cover their diet for at least 5 months. Households with LLR {\textless} 1 were also those who generated more than 50{\%} of their total income outside the farm. Dependence on off/non-farm income was one of the main factors associated with household diversity. Based on indicators of resource endowment and income strategies and using principal component analysis, farmers' rankings and cluster analysis the 250 households surveyed were grouped into five farm types: (1) Farms that rely mainly on permanent off-farm employment (from 10 to 28{\%} of the farmers interviewed, according to site); (2) larger, wealthier farms growing cash crops (8-20{\%}); (3) medium resource endowment, food self-sufficient farms (20-38{\%}); (4) medium to low resource endowment relying partly on non-farm activities (18-30{\%}); and (5) poor households with family members employed locally as agricultural labourers by wealthier farmers (13-25{\%}). Due to differential soil management over long periods of time, and to ample diversity in resource endowments (land, livestock, labour) and access to cash, the five farm types exhibited different soil carbon and nutrient stocks (e.g. Type 2 farms had average C, N, P and K stocks that were 2-3 times larger than for Types 4 or 5). In general, soil spatial variability was larger in farms (and sites) with poorer soils and smaller in farms owning livestock. The five farm types identified may be seen as domains to target technological innovations and/or development efforts. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We reviewed existing theories and frameworks for the uptake of agricultural innovations and found that these tend to emphasize the role of extrinsic factors such as the characteristics of the adopter and the external environment in the decision-making process. In this paper, we argue that intrinsic factors such as the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of the potential adopter towards the innovation play a key role, but this has been less studied. We present an analytical framework that combines both extrinsic and intrinsic factors in farmers' decisions to adopt new agricultural technologies and apply the framework to agroforestry adoption as a case study. We review the literature on agroforestry adoption in sub-Saharan Africa and identify the extrinsic and intrinsic variables affecting the uptake of agroforestry technologies. We conclude that the uptake of agricultural technologies is a complex process influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic variables, and recommend that future studies aiming to understand the adoption process of agricultural innovations take into account both sets of variables. A mechanistic understanding of how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact and drive adoption can help in targeting technologies appropriately to ensure sustainability.},

abstract = {In recent years, agricultural extension services in developing countries have increasingly introduced modern information and communication technologies (ICT)to deliver advice. But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania independently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmers' information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2–4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific “top 3” options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmers' preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48–68{\%}, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from farmers, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice.},

abstract = {To determine the most important production constraints and associated yield losses for six major food crops in 13 farming systems with high poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and East Asia, surveys were conducted with 672 experts representing a diversity of backgrounds and experience. Respondents reported large gaps between highest achieved crop yield on smallholder farms and average yield on farm. Yield gaps were smallest for rice (about 60{\%} of current average smallholder farm grain yields), mid size for wheat and cassava, and larger (sometimes double current farm yields) for sorghum, cowpea and chickpea. Gaps were also smaller in the high input and yield farming systems of East Asia and largest in the marginal, drier systems, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Four categories of production constraint (abiotic, biotic, management and socio-economic) were considered important contributors to yield gaps. A diversity of specific constraints was reported for the crops in the different systems. The most severe and widespread specific constraints for wheat involved the deficiency, high cost and poor management of N fertilizer, and problems associated with drought stress at grain filling, mid season drought and irrigation management. Those for rice included N fertilizer problems, soil fertility depletion, various leaf, stem and head pests and diseases, weed competition and inadequate water management. Striga and weed competition, soil resource degradation, poor soil fertility management, and drought were the most severe specific constraints for sorghum. Insect pests of pod, leaf, stem and flower and the high cost of their control dominated the constraint set for cowpea. Helicoverpa pod borer, Botrytis grey mould and control costs were the most severe for chickpea. Unsuitable varieties/poor seed, soil infertility and fertilizer constraints were also widespread with the legumes. Marketing problems and lack of finance were concerns for cassava along with weed competition, African cassava mosaic virus and poor varieties/planting materials. The findings can help to inform priority setting for international agricultural research and development activities on important food crops in major farming systems occupying areas of high poverty. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. {\&} International Society for Plant Pathology.},

Big Data technologies, together with the increased use of cloud based and high performance computing, create new opportunities for data intensive science in the multi-disciplinary agro-environmental domain. A theoretical framework is presented to structure and analyse data-intensive cases and is applied to three case studies, together covering a broad range of technologies and aspects related to Big Data usage. The case studies indicate that most persistent issues in the area of data-intensive research evolve around capturing the huge heterogeneity of interdisciplinary data and around creating trust between data providers and data users. It is therefore recommended that efforts from the agro-environmental domain concentrate on the issues of variety and veracity.},

abstract = {The “4R” fertilizer management principles of using the right rate, right source, right timing and right place is emergently required for enhancing crop production and improving crop Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) in intensive small farming system. However, the methodology is still vague to design and implement technologies and management practices (TMPs) following the “4R” principles in these regions. This study designs various TMPs and evaluates their agronomic, environmental, and economic impacts in two typical intensive cereals cropping systems in China to explore how TMPs interact with biophysical conditions, and finally establish methodologies to recommend local optimal TMPs. Among 5 designed TMPs, the optimal TMPs for each site and cropping system were selected, which achieved the sustainable targets for productivity (80{\%} of the achievable yield potential), NUE (0.60), and economic profitability. But several TMPs failed to satisfy the integrated targets, which implied the TMPs must be carefully designed to fit site-specific biophysical contexts. This work provided some basic guidelines for determining each “R”: The “Right rate” can be determined by balancing with crop aboveground N uptake where soil testing is not always available. The “Right timing” must consider the fertilizer products and local climatic features. Split application is not always better than one-time application, e.g., applying urea at 11th-leaf stage decreased spring maize yield by 9{\%} at Lishu due to a 20-day sustained high temperature and drought condition. For the “Right source”, the adoption of enhanced efficiency fertilizers should take soil properties (especially soil pH) into consideration, e.g., urease inhibitors are effective in increasing NUE (by 44{\%}) on alkaline soils, but the efficacy on acid soils is greatly reduced (by 19{\%}). The “Right place” needs to be designed according to characteristics of crop root distribution and fertilizer sources, e.g., surface application of urease inhibitors in winter wheat gained greater NUE (0.62) and grain yield (8.3 Mg ha−1) than deep placement of urea and calcium ammonium nitrate. Considering the biophysical condition variations and its great influence on TMPs, a long-term trial research network to design, test and reshape the site-specific optimal TMPs following “4R” principles will be necessary.},

abstract = {In village economies, dense social networks support cooperation and exchange between citizens. The global shift towards hiring agents from within communities to deliver programs implies that the networks these agents are embedded in may affect delivery. We examine this using a randomized evaluation of an agricultural extension program in Uganda where we randomly pick one of two potential local delivery agents and map ties between delivery agents and farmers, between delivery agents and between farmers. Consistent with a model of favor exchange in social networks we find that (i) farmers tied to the chosen delivery agent are more likely to be treated than those tied to the counterfactual agent, (ii) this preferential treatment disappears when the two potential agents are tied by friendship, family or politics and (iii) when this is not the case the delivery agent actively prevents program benefits from diffusing to the ties of of the counterfactual agent. These results reveal the deep influence that social networks have on program delivery and help us to understand the highly unequal pattern of effects of the program both within and across villages. * We thank participants at numerous seminars and conferences for their comments and especially Sanjeev Goyal, Matt Jackson and Michael Kremer for insightful suggestions.},

abstract = {Numerous sources provide evidence of trends and patterns in average farm size and farmland distribution worldwide, but they often lack documentation, are in some cases out of date, and do not provide comprehensive global and comparative regional estimates. This article uses agricultural census data (provided at the country level in Web Appendix) to show that there are more than 570 million farms worldwide, most of which are small and family-operated. It shows that small farms (less than 2 ha) operate about 12{\%} and family farms about 75{\%} of the world's agricultural land. It shows that average farm size decreased in most low- and lower-middle-income countries for which data are available from 1960 to 2000, whereas average farm sizes increased from 1960 to 2000 in some upper-middle-income countries and in nearly all high-income countries for which we have information. Such estimates help inform agricultural development strategies, although the estimates are limited by the data available. Continued efforts to enhance the collection and dissemination of up-to date, comprehensive, and more standardized agricultural census data, including at the farm and national level, are essential to having a more representative picture of the number of farms, small farms, and family farms as well as changes in farm size and farmland distribution worldwide.},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers are excluded from efficient and effective participation in high-value agro-food market chains due to major competitiveness constraints and several market failures along these chains. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in a more coordinated and sustainable way that promote their effective and efficient participation in high-value agro-food market chains. In particular, the study aims at determining the main role of households' capitals, institutional, and access-related factors in conditioning the decision of smallholder farmers of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) to access pillars of competitiveness in high-value market chains (HVMCs). For this purpose, a unique household-level data from a total of 1232 rural and peri-urban AIV-producing households were surveyed, and the data obtained were analysed by using a multivariate probit model. The results suggest that about two thirds of smallholder AIV farmers had access to at least one pillar of competitiveness in HVMCs. The model results show the presence of inter-dependency of household level decisions to access multiple pillars of competitiveness in HVMCs. Furthermore, the results also reveal that coping with shocks, coupled with access to information on market prices and warnings of unexpected events, contract farming, certification and modern irrigation technologies are the main conditioning factors to the access of the pillars of competitiveness by smallholder farmers. The promotion and implementation of a well-founded mobile phone-based information access platforms, as well as effective and efficient livelihood strategies that support smallholder farmers to access pillars of competitiveness, is of critical importance towards overcoming the major competitiveness constraints along high-value agro-food chains.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that agriculture is a major driver of climate change as well as being acutely challenged to adapt to its effects. Agroecological approaches involve the application of integrated ecological, economic and social principles to the transition of smallholder farming systems, towards greater resilience. This involves adapting 13 generic agroecological principles to local circumstances. The principles include: diversification, recycling, and better connecting producers and consumers. Adaptation is done by scientists working closely with farmers and other stakeholders to co-create concrete, demand-led solutions to pressing problems as they are experienced locally rather than through imposing externally prefabricated solutions that may not be locally appropriate. Agroecology comprises transdisciplinary science; sustainable agricultural practices; and, social movements that are precipitating widespread behaviour change. Agroecological principles map closely to principles of adaptation with the notable exception that while they often exhibit resilience benefits, these are incidental rather than representing an explicit response to climate signals. Current market failures (for example not costing pollution nor valuing the maintenance of soil organic carbon); and, perverse policy incentives (for example subsidizing use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides) combine to mitigate against decisions for farmers and other food system actors to adopt agroecological approaches despite their benefits for climate resilience. Agroecology manifests at field, farm and landscape scales, for which different metrics of agricultural performance are relevant in order for agroecological practices to be fairly judged against alternatives. Operationalising new and holistic performance metrics for agriculture will require innovation in both public and private (value chain) sector governance.},

Increasing crop diversity through intercropping addresses the problem of increasing land utilization and crop productivity. In collaboration with farmers and extension personnel, we tested intercropping of tobacco, maize, sugarcane, potato, wheat and broad bean--either by relay cropping or by mixing crop species based on differences in their heights, and practiced these patterns on 15,302 hectares in ten counties in Yunnan Province, China. The results of observation plots within these areas showed that some combinations increased crop yields for the same season between 33.2 and 84.7{\%} and reached a land equivalent ratio (LER) of between 1.31 and 1.84.

abstract = {Conservation agriculture through the use of crop residue retention and no-tillage (NT) has been widely practiced to improve agricultural soil quality, such as to increase soil organic carbon (C) content and the microbial population size. However, there has been no quantitative analysis on the effect of conservation agriculture, particularly in relation to crop residue retention, on soil microbial biomass C (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic), and the microbial quotient (qMIC, Cmic-to-organic C ratio), which are frequently used as indicators of soil health under different agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of conservation agriculture practices on soil Cmic, Nmic and qMIC on a global scale using meta-analysis based on data from 96 recent publications. Relative to conventional tillage (CT) without residue retention, NT without residue retention (NTR0) increased Cmic by 33{\%} (P {\textless}0.05), while NT with residue retention (NTR) increased (P {\textless}0.05) Cmic, Nmic, and qMIC by 25, 64, and 57{\%}, respectively. Greater Cmic and Nmic were found in the NT than in the CT treatment, regardless of the soil condition (e.g., soil pH and texture), experimental duration, and climate (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation). Particularly, NTR was a promising conservation agriculture practice to increase Cmic and Nmic in global farmlands, and NTR0 can be an alternate strategy for loam soils in the subhumid (600–1000 mm mean annual precipitation) region, or under long-term ({\textgreater}20 yr) conservation agriculture practices. We conclude that NTR should be an important strategy that could be used to increase Cmic and Nmic contents and improve soil quality in global farmlands.},

abstract = {Soil macrofauna such as earthworms and termites are involved in key ecosystem functions and thus considered important for sustainable intensification of crop production. However, their contribution to tropical soil quality and crop performance, as well as relations with agricultural management (e.g., Conservation Agriculture), are not well understood. This study aimed to quantify soil macrofauna and its impact on soil aggregation, soil carbon and crop yields in a maize-soybean system under tropical sub-humid conditions. A field trial was established in Western Kenya in 2003 with tillage and residue retention as independent factors. A macrofauna exclusion experiment was superimposed in 2005 through regular insecticide applications, and measurements were taken from 2005 to 2012. Termites were the most abundant macrofauna group comprising 61{\%} of total macrofauna numbers followed by ants (20{\%}), while few earthworms were present (5{\%}). Insecticide application significantly reduced termites (by 86 and 62{\%}) and earthworms (by 100 and 88{\%}) at 0-15 and 15-30. cm soil depth respectively. Termite diversity was low, with all species belonging to the family of Macrotermitinae which feed on wood, leaf litter and dead/dry grass. Seven years of macrofauna exclusion did not affect soil aggregation or carbon contents, which might be explained by the low residue retention and the nesting and feeding behavior of the dominant termites present. Macrofauna exclusion resulted in 34{\%} higher maize grain yield and 22{\%} higher soybean grain yield, indicating that pest damage - probably including termites - overruled any potentially beneficial impact of soil macrofauna. Results contrast with previous studies on the effects of termites on plant growth, which were mostly conducted in (semi-) arid regions. Future research should contribute to sustainable management strategies that reduce detrimental impact due to dominance of potential pest species while conserving soil macrofauna diversity and their beneficial functions in agroecosystems.},

We discuss the state of models relative to five different Use Cases spanning field, farm, landscape, regional, and global spatial scales and engaging questions in past, current, and future time periods. Contributions from multiple disciplines have made major advances relevant to a wide range of agricultural system model applications at various spatial and temporal scales. Although current agricultural systems models have features that are needed for the Use Cases, we found that all of them have limitations and need to be improved. We identified common limitations across all Use Cases, namely 1) a scarcity of data for developing, evaluating, and applying agricultural system models and 2) inadequate knowledge systems that effectively communicate model results to society. We argue that these limitations are greater obstacles to progress than gaps in conceptual theory or available methods for using system models. New initiatives on open data show promise for addressing the data problem, but there also needs to be a cultural change among agricultural researchers to ensure that data for addressing the range of Use Cases are available for future model improvements and applications. We conclude that multiple platforms and multiple models are needed for model applications for different purposes.

Yet, these analyses neglect temporal yield stability, or the variability and reliability of production across years. Here we perform a meta-analysis to assess temporal yield stability of three major cropping systems: organic agriculture and conservation agriculture (no-tillage) vs. conventional agriculture, comparing 193 studies based on 2896 comparisons. Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a significantly lower temporal stability (−15{\%}) compared to conventional agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on reducing its yield variability. Our analysis further indicates that the use of green manure and enhanced fertilisation can reduce the yield stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture. The temporal stability (−3{\%}) of no-tillage does not differ significantly from those of conventional tillage indicating that a transition to no-tillage does not affect yield stability.},

abstract = {Background: The fatty acid (FA) composition of the red blood cell (RBC) has been reported to provide prognostic information regarding risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). In particular, the Omega-3 Index (RBC eicosapentaenoic acid+docosahexaenoic acid, EPA+DHA) has been shown to be independently and inversely related to risk for sudden cardiac death and for acute coronary syndromes. Higher linoleic acid (n-6) and lower trans FA levels have also been associated with improved CHD outcomes. Accordingly, the RBC FA panel has recently been introduced in routine clinical laboratory testing. Objective: The purpose of this study was to define age- and gender-based norms for RBC FA levels. Methods: RBC FA profiles from about 160,000 patients (48{\%} from males, 52{\%} from females) were measured at Health Diagnostic Laboratory. These data were used to create age decade and gender-specific norms (percentiles). FA values were expressed as a percent of total identified FA. Results: Compared to men, women generally had higher C18 trans levels, and between the ages of 10-29 years, they had DHA and lower EPA levels. Among the major FA classes, saturated (41{\%} of total) and trans ({\~{}}0.85{\%}) fats did not vary appreciably by age, whereas monounsaturated fats tended to rise slightly. Of the two major n-6 polyunsaturates, arachidonic and linoleic acids, the former was unchanged across decades (16.4{\%} abundance) whereas the latter decreased by about 2 percentage points (13.0-11.1{\%}). The overall median Omega-3 Index was 4.5{\%}, and across the decades it increased by about 1.5 percentage points. The Omega-3 Index and linoleic acid stabilized after age 70. Conclusion: Whereas RBC saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated FA levels are generally stable across the lifespan, there is a shift in the composition of the latter, with an increase in the Omega-3 Index and a decrease in linoleic acid. Higher DHA and lower EPA levels in younger women is consistent with enhanced conversion of EPA to DHA during the early reproductive years. The availability of RBC FA norms will facilitate research into the relationships between altered FA status and human disease, and will help physicians evaluate the n-3 FA status of their patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Maize grain yields in the U.S. started to rise in the late 1930s, concurrent with introduction of hybrids and improved cultural methods. On-farm yield gains averaged 115 kg ha -1 yr -1 during the years 1934-2004. Genetic improvements have been responsible for ca. 50-60{\%} of the on-farm gains, and changes in cultural practices (management) are responsible for the remainder. But because breeding and management interact with each other, neither factor could have raised yields without concurrent and complementary changes in the other. Numerous estimates of genetic yield gain of maize hybrids have shown, without exception, that genetic yield gains during the past 70 years have been positive and linear. Estimates of the average annual gain vary but tend to fall in the range of 65-75 kg ha -1 yr -1. Over the years, hybrids have changed significantly in phenotype, in tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and in genotype as measured by pedigree and molecular markers. Phenotypic changes may indicate improvements in efficiency of grain production (e.g., smaller tassels may release more energy for gain production). Stress tolerance is greatly improved; newer hybrids outyield the older ones not only in high yield environments but also when trials are subjected to abiotic stress (e.g., heat and drought) or to biotic stress (e.g., insect pests). Absolute heterosis for grain yield has increased over the years to a small extent, in particular when trials are subjected to abiotic stress, but the increase is considerably less than total genetic gain. Yield potential per plant has not increased over the years. Newer hybrids yield more than older hybrids because of continuing improvement in ability of the hybrids to withstand the stress of higher plant density, which in turn is owed to their greater tolerance to locally important abiotic and biotic stresses.},

Research Series Issue 63: The adoption of improved agricultural technologies - A meta-analysis for Africa
August 2020
Understanding the determinants of improved agricultural technology adoption is an important component of increasing agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholders to reduce poverty and hunger. In this paper, particular attention is given to the identification and promotion of productivity and resilience enhancing agricultural practices.

Although numerous seminal reviews of this literature have been published, most of these were theoretical or conceptual reviews and focus on earlier literature from continents other than Africa, which is the continent facing the biggest productivity challenge now.

The authors synthesize the findings of this literature with a focus on Africa using a meta-data set that brings together the results of 168 recently published papers. They find that most of this literature focuses on agronomic practices and that agroforestry and livestock related studies make up less than one fifth of the total published papers.

Eleven determinants, primarily those related to information access, wealth indicators and tenure security, are found to increase adoption more than chance would dictate in the literature. The findings provide evidence to support recommendations for future policy and research.},

abstract = {Given that crop yield in smallholder farms is influenced by rainfall and soil variability, farmers have designed strategies to address water deficit and enhance productivity, including adopting agroforestry. However, there is insufficient evidence demonstrating the combined effect of rainfall variability, soil heterogeneity and agroforestry treatment on maize productivity in semi-arid Kenya. We evaluated performance of agroforestry trees (Vachellia seyal, V. xanthophloea, Cordia africana, Faidherbia albida and Grevillea robusta) in monoculture and mixed-species treatments in a long-term experiment in Kiambu, Kenya, and their influence on maize intercrop. The trial was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design having a mix of Cambisol and Vertisol soils. Tree growth and phenology was monitored monthly while maize yield assessed in four cropping seasons. Growth was higher in 2014 for all species compared to other years (P {\textless}.001). Cordia africana and F. albida in mixed stand and Cambisols exceeded those in monoculture and Vertisols (P {\textless}.001). Maize yield grown under C. africana and mixed-species during 2015/16 season was 54{\%} and 44{\%} higher than the control with corresponding canopy transmittance values of 18{\%} and 24{\%} respectively. Maize yield was highest in 2013/14 season (4.2 t ha−1) with rainfall distribution affecting productivity in 2014/15 season whereby 74{\%} of rainfall was received in 1 month resulting in crop failure. These findings demonstrate the reality of climate (rainfall) variability, and the influence of soil properties heterogeneity while supporting call for mixed-species and encouraging efforts aimed at forecasting rainfall patterns as this affects farming operations.},

abstract = {Rapid climatic and socio-economic changes challenge current agricultural R{\&}D capacity. The necessary quantum leap in knowledge generation should build on the innovation capacity of farmers themselves. A novel citizen science methodology, triadic comparisons of technologies or tricot, was implemented in pilot studies in India, East Africa, and Central America. The methodology involves distributing a pool of agricultural technologies in different combinations of three to individual farmers who observe these technologies under farm conditions and compare their performance. Since the combinations of three technologies overlap, statistical methods can piece together the overall performance ranking of the complete pool of technologies. The tricot approach affords wide scaling, as the distribution of trial packages and instruction sessions is relatively easy to execute, farmers do not need to be organized in collaborative groups, and feedback is easy to collect, even by phone. The tricot approach provides interpretable, meaningful results and was widely accepted by farmers. The methodology underwent improvement in data input formats. A number of methodological issues remain: integrating environmental analysis, capturing gender-specific differences, stimulating farmers' motivation, and supporting implementation with an integrated digital platform. Future studies should apply the tricot approach to a wider range of technologies, quantify its potential contribution to climate adaptation, and embed the approach in appropriate institutions and business models, empowering participants and democratizing science.},

The debate is anchored on the premise that the private sector is more efficient in extension service delivery. This study evaluates the private extension system in Kenya. It employs qualitative and quantitative methods. The results indicate that the private extension is skewed towards high potential regions because it is either driven by profits or quick results. The private system benefits from the public extension staff, thus some form of commercial contracting of public staff to serve the private systems is appropriate. Public extension should not overlap in the areas efficiently served by the private system. The government should consider contracting the private sector to deliver extension to neglected areas.

Our objective was to determine whether AF systems' recommendations that solely consider impacts on average maize yields differ from those that include an analysis of production risk, profitability among different wealth groups and socioeconomic vulnerability. Employing participatory quantitative and qualitative on-farm research techniques, we investigated three AF-based maize/legume relay-cropping practices in southern Malawi. The perennial legumes included Sesbania sesban, Tephrosia vogelii and Cajanus cajan (pigeonpea). We found that AF species recommendations did diverge from those based solely on maximizing maize yields when incorporating risk, profitability and socioeconomic vulnerability as additional variables. For instance, the highest yielding system (the S. sesban/maize relay crop) was never recommended for the most vulnerable farmers based on the vulnerability analysis, and the cropping systems were often more profitable for the least vulnerable farmers than they were for the most vulnerable farmers. Cropping system recommendations based solely on obtaining the highest average maize yields would also have generally overlooked the economic and nutritional importance of pigeonpea, and the difficulty for the most vulnerable farmers to profit from fertilizers, potentially placing these farmers at greater risk. {\textcopyright} 2010 Earthscan.},

abstract = {Manure is a key nutrient resource on smallholder farms in the tropics, especially on poorly buffered sandy soils, due to its multiple benefits for soil fertility. Farmers preferentially apply manure to fields closest to homesteads (homefields), which are more fertile than fields further away (outfields). A three-year experiment was established on homefields and outfields on sandy and clayey soils to assess the effects of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer application in combination with manure or mineral phosphorus (P) on maize yields and soil chemical properties. Significant maize responses to application of N and manure were observed on all fields except the depleted sandy outfield. Large amounts of manure (17 t ha-1 year-1) were required to significantly increase soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, available P, and base saturation, and restore productivity of the depleted sandy outfield. Sole N as ammonium nitrate (100 kg N ha-1) or in combination with single superphosphate led to acidification of the sandy soils, with a decrease of up to 0.8 pH units after three seasons. In a greenhouse experiment, N and calcium (Ca) were identified as deficient in the sandy homefield, while N, P, Ca, and zinc (Zn) were deficient or low on the sandy outfield. The deficiencies of Ca and Zn were alleviated by the addition of manure. This study highlights the essential role of manure in sustaining and replenishing soil fertility on smallholder farms through its multiple effects, although it should be used in combination with N mineral fertilizers due to its low capacity to supply N. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In many developing countries, such as Kenya, information on the mean changes in climate is limited. Therefore, in this study, we model the current and future changes in areas suitable for rainfed maize production in the country using a maximum entropy (MaxENT) model. Maize is by far a major staple food crop in Kenya. We used maize occurrence location data and bioclimatic variables for two climatic scenarios-Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 from two general circulation models (HadGEM2-ES and CCSM4) for 2070. The study identified the annual mean temperature, annual precipitation and the mean temperature of the wettest quarter as the major variables that affect the distribution of maize. Simulation results indicate an average increase of unsuitable areas of between 1.9–3.9{\%} and a decrease of moderately suitable areas of 14.6–17.5{\%}. The change in the suitable areas is an increase of between 17–20{\%} and in highly suitable areas of 9.6{\%} under the climatic scenarios. The findings of this study are of utmost importance to the country as they present an opportunity for policy makers to develop appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies required to sustain maize production under future climates.},

abstract = {Improving fertilizer use efficiency has remained a challenge, particularly for small-scale farming in undulating 'abnormal' landscapes of East Africa. Milne's 1930s concept on 'Catena' was considered as a breakthrough in understanding soil variability and its implication on productivity in East African highlands. However, there is limited information on how the 'Catena' features could be used for fine tuning fertilizer recommendations. We initiated multiple on-farm replicated experiments in three wheat-growing districts (Endamohoni, Lemo and Worreilu) in the Ethiopian highlands in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to assess landscape positions affecting crop-nutrient responses, identify yield limiting nutrients across the 'Catena' (N, P, K, S and Zn) and quantify effects of landscape positions on resources use efficiency. We clustered farmlands across the 'Catena' (Hillslopes, Midslopes and Footslopes) based on land scape positions in the respective locations. Wheat yield was more strongly and significantly affected by landscape positions (P {\textless} 0.001) than by nutrient sources or rates. The crop response to fertilizers was 50 to 300{\%} higher in foot slopes than in hillslopes, depending on locations and inputs levels. With increasing slope, there was a decrease in a crop fertilizer response due to a significant decrease in soil organic carbon, clay content and soil water content, with r2 of 0.95, 0.86 and 0.96, respectively. The difference in the crop response between landscape positions was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) with higher rates of nutrient applications ({\textgreater}N92 P46) while differences between landscape positions diminish at lower rates. Yield benefits due to application of K was significant only in the dry years (P {\textless} 0.05), while there was hardly any yield benefit from the application of zinc and sulfur. The crop nitrogen recovery fraction and crop water productivity decreased with an increasing slope regardless of nutrient combinations. The results indicated that the landscape position could be considered as a proxy indicator for targeted fertilizer application, particularly in farms with undulating topographic features. Hillslopes are better served by the application of organic fertilizers along with conservation measures as applying higher rates of mineral fertilizer in hillslopes would rather increase the risk of downstream nutrient movement.},

abstract = {Appropriate sustainable intensification (SI) of agriculture is required in Sub-Saharan Africa to meet the rising demand for food and protect resources. Agroforestry and green manures, diversification with grain legumes, conservation agriculture and integrated nutrient management with mineral and organic fertilizers are SI options widely promoted for maize-based African smallholder systems. To assess the potential of SI options to contribute to multiple ecosystem services in these systems, we evaluated 17 published multi-year and site studies, using radar charts to systematically measure provisioning services (annualized maize grain and protein yields) and supporting services (vegetative biomass, rain productivity and agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer) among the studies and across technologies. We frequently observed trade-offs amongst provisioning and supporting ecosystem services, especially in rotational systems where the addition of a grain legume increased maize response to fertilizer but reduced annualized maize grain yields. Consistent gains in maize grain yield and vegetative biomass, and protein yield and rain productivity were obtained with the application of N fertilizer across the studies. More efficient use of N fertilizer was associated with legume diversification, particularly intercrop systems, with large incremental yield gains (30–80 kg grain kg−1 N fertilizer) at low fertilizer rates ({\textless} 50 kg N ha−1). These systems produced substantial amounts of grain, protein, vegetative biomass and high resource use efficiency (1 to 5-fold increase relative to sole maize). In contrast, performance was inconsistent from conservation tillage practices. The highly variable performance of many options that contribute to SI suggests the importance of their adaptation to local conditions and support for farmer innovation, rather than prescribing the use of fixed SI interventions. Overall, for maize system intensification, we suggest expanding farmer access to multipurpose legumes (such as long-duration pigeon pea) that provide food and copious biomass, and to N fertilizer, along with the local adaptation of water-conserving tillage practices.},

In comparison with the traditional Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, HMC offers greater computational efficiency, especially in higher dimensional or more complex modeling situations.

Its implementation, either through Stan or one of its derivative programs, can appear opaque to beginners. A lack of understanding of the inner working of HMC, in our opinion, has hindered its application to a broader range of statistical problems. In this article, we review the basic concepts of HMC in a language that is more familiar to statisticians, and we describe an HMC implementation in R, one of the most frequently used statistical software environments. We also present hmclearn, an R package for learning HMC. This package contains a general-purpose HMC function for data analysis. We illustrate the use of this package in common statistical models. In doing so, we hope to promote this powerful computational tool for wider use. Example code for common statistical models is presented as supplementary material for online publication.},

However, the costs and benefits to farmers adopting no-till are hotly debated 1–4. Using a meta-analysis of unprecedented study size, Pittelkow et al.5 reported that adopting no-till results in average yield losses of -5.7{\%}, but that these losses can be limited with the added implementation of two additional conservation agriculture practices - crop rotation and crop residue retention, and in dry environments. They claimed that, as a result, resource limited smallholder farmers, that are unable to implement the whole suite of conservation agriculture practices are likely to experience yield losses under no-till. In a re-evaluation of their analysis, we found that they overly biased their results toward showing that no-till negatively impacts yields, and overlooked the practical significance of their findings. Strikingly, we find that all of the variables they used in their analysis (e.g. crop residue management, rotation, site aridity and study duration) are not much better than random for explaining the effect of no-till on crop yields. Our results suggest that their meta-analysis cannot be used as the basis for evidence-based decision-making in the agricultural community.},

abstract = {Abstract: With the dawn of the technological age due to the wide spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs), e-government is fast becoming of prime importance. This has prompted many governments (those of Sub-Saharan African - SSA included) to start thinking of going digital. This growing importance stems from the fact that e-government has the capability of promoting better governance, transparency, raising service performance and eliminating bottlenecks in the service delivery process. This paper is based on a literature review of the papers and documents relating to e-government and investigates the challenges to the successful implementation of e-government initiatives in all the 49 African countries in SSA for the period 2001 to 2012. In order to conduct a systematic review the guidelines suggested by Webster and Watson (2002) and Okoli and Schabram (2010) have been followed. In total 75 relevant articles and documents have been examined all of which have been published in leading journals, conferences proceedings, reports from governmental and non-governmental organizations. The results show that ICT infrastructure, human resources, legal framework, Internet access, the digital divide, and connectivity are among the most common themes on the challenges to the successful implementation of e-government initiatives in Sub-Saharan African countries. These themes are further grouped into six different aspects abbreviated as IF-POSH (Infrastructural, financial, political, organisational, socio-economic and human). Among these six aspects, infrastructural and human aspects are the most important challenges that the respective governments in SSA need to address prior to adopting implementation strategies. The study suggests that governments of the Sub-Saharan African countries can benefit from the advantages of e-government if they address these challenges collectively allowing for the sensitivity of certain socio-economic realities.},

Their potential value to the African food system could be enhanced if their benefits were explored more comprehensively. This synthesis presents a literature review relating to underutilized indigenous crop species and foods in Africa. It organizes the findings into four main contributions, nutritional, environmental, economic, and social-cultural, in line with key themes of a sustainable food system framework. It also goes on to unpack the benefits and challenges associated with ITFCs under these themes. A major obstacle is that people are not valuing indigenous foods and the potential benefit that can be derived from using them is thus neglected. Furthermore, knowledge is being lost from one generation to the next, with potentially dire implications for long-term sustainable food security. The results show the need to recognize and enable indigenous foods as a key resource in ensuring healthy food systems in the African continent.},

abstract = {Climate resilience is increasingly prioritized by international development agencies and national governments. However, current approaches to informing communities of future climate risk are problematic. The predominant focus on end-of-century projections neglects more pressing development concerns, which relate to the management of shorter-term risks and climate variability, and constitutes a substantial opportunity cost for the limited financial and human resources available to tackle development challenges. When a long-term view genuinely is relevant to decision-making, much of the information available is not fit for purpose. Climate model projections are able to capture many aspects of the climate system and so can be relied upon to guide mitigation plans and broad adaptation strategies, but the use of these models to guide local, practical adaptation actions is unwarranted. Climate models are unable to represent future conditions at the degree of spatial, temporal, and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided, which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information. In this article, we outline these issues, review their history, and provide a set of practical steps for both the development and climate scientist communities to consider. Solutions to mobilize the best available science include a focus on decision-relevant timescales, an increased role for model evaluation and expert judgment and the integration of climate variability into climate change services.

However, evidence on the role of gender-based perceptions on households' food security and related implications on the households' nutritional status is limited. This study examines the determinants of gender-disaggregated household food security perceptions among smallholder farming households. We used two panels of data from households in eastern and western Kenya and employ the House hold Food Insecurity Access Scale to measure perceptions of household food insecurity, and the random effects generalized ordered probit model to evaluate the determinants of security perceptions across gender. The results reveal that the factors that influence food security perceptions vary across gender. The education level of household head and the number of relatives were negatively associated with female perceptions of household food insecurity, whereas the household dependency ratio was positively associated with female perceptions of household food insecurity. In contrast, age and gender of household head were positively correlated with male perception of household food insecurity. The findings suggest that gender matters in household food security perceptions and that the determinants of the food security perceptions vary across gender.},

The group consisted of a mixture of experts with backgrounds in research, academia, government, farmers and development practitioners, and the book reflects the knowledge and perspectives of these various groups. The book begins by describing the rationale behind the initiative followed by a clarification on the background and approach taken. Chapter three then describes the Eastern African region and argues why there is a need to build resilience in the livelihoods of communities living in drylands. Chapter four builds on this by introducing an ecosystem services perspective as the conceptual framework to explore the resilience offered by trees. Chapter five reviews the ecology, distribution and use of trees throughout the Eastern African region. Chapter six uses an ecosystem service perspective to review the various benefits that people derive from dryland trees. Chapter seven draws on experiences gained in development practices and presents and reviews 11 case studies of natural resource management. Chapter eight presents reflections of the write-shop participants on how best practice in resilience-building could be scaled up. A review of knowledge and information gaps regarding the contribution of trees in building resilience is presented in chapter nine, which is followed by a plan for possible follow-up action in chapter ten.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Intercrops of cereals and legumes are grown worldwide, both in smallholder agriculture in developing countries and in organic farming systems in developed countries. The competitive balance between species is a key factor determining productivity in mixtures. Management factors, e.g. sowing time, sowing density and rate of N fertilizer, affect the relative competitiveness and performance of intercropped species. There is a need for an overarching analysis to elucidate general principles governing the relative performance of legumes and cereals in mixtures. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to explore how the relative yield of legumes and cereals in mixtures responds to relative sowing time, relative density and nitrogen fertilizer. An index for relative sowing time, RST, was developed to quantify the relative difference in sowing time between the intercropped species. RST is defined as the amount of time that a species is sown earlier or later than its companion species, relative to the length of its own growing period. RST is smaller than zero if a species is sown earlier than its companion species and greater than zero if it is sown later. Relative performance of a species was characterized by its relative yield (or partial land equivalent ratio, PLER) in the intercrop compared to the yield in the sole crop. In 409 out of 552 cases, the cereal had a greater relative yield than the legume. Sowing a species earlier than its companion increased its relative yield, and vice versa. An increase in density of a species increased its relative yield and decreased the relative yield of the companion species. The relative yield of cereals increased and that of legumes decreased with the amount of N fertilizer. The negative effect of N on the relative yield of legumes was mitigated if the legume was sown before the cereal. The study shows how the performance of cereals and legumes in an intercrop is affected by sowing densities, relative sowing times, and nitrogen fertilizer. Growers can exploit these relationships to manage competition between cereals and legumes in mixtures and enhance species complementarity, total productivity and economic profit.},

Adaptation strategies to climate change in maize systems in sub-Saharan Africa are likely to include improved germplasm with tolerance to drought and heat stress and improved management practices. Adapting maize systems to future climates requires the ability to accurately predict future climate scenarios in order to determine agricultural responses to climate change and set priorities for adaptation strategies. Here we review the projected climate change scenarios for Africa's maize growing regions using the outputs of 19 global climate models. By 2050, air temperatures are expected to increase throughout maize mega- environments within sub-Saharan Africa by an average of 2.1°C. Rainfall changes during the maize growing season varied with location. Given the time lag between the development of improved cultivars until the seed is in the hands of farmers and adoption of new management practices, there is an urgent need to prioritise research strategies on climate change resilient germplasm development to offset the predicted yield declines. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Soil structure quality can be scored by visual examinations or measured with soil physical properties. To investigate the relationships between these two approaches, we adapted the VESS (Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure, Guimar{\~{a}}es et al., 2011) to the scoring of cores (CoreVESS) on which shrinkage analysis was also performed. Scoring was performed blindly after equilibrating the samples at −100 hPa matric potential and was compared to soil texture, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil hydrostructural stability, structural porosity, plasma porosity, bulk soil porosity or density, and water content at standard matric potential. A large geographical area of Cambi-Luvisols was sampled at 55 locations with different soil management in western Switzerland. VESS was performed on the pits and layers prior to sampling undisturbed cores. Sandy soils presented medium CoreVESS scores compared to clayey soils. Only soils with more than 20{\%} clay content obtained good scores in this study. The relationships between CoreVESS scores, SOC and most physical properties followed a broken-stick regression, with most breaking points close to score 3. Most regressions were significant and highly determined with R2 above 0.45. Linear decrease with CoreVESS scores was observed for total porosity and bulk density of air-dried soil and for water content at −10hPa. The underlying model of structural quality decrease can be summarized as follows. From score 1 to 3 the decrease in structure quality corresponds to a decrease in SOC. From score 1 to 2 occurs most of the decrease in coarse porosity volume. From score 3 to 5 the decrease of structure quality corresponds to a loss of structural porosity, which converges to 0 cm−3 g−1 for score 5, and to a collapse of the samples upon drying between scores 3 and 4, thus denoting a loss of hydrostructural stability. VESS scores of pits and layers were poorly correlated to CoreVESS scores and physical properties, probably due to local variability of the sampled layers. Our results suggest that the relation between visual scoring and physical properties is not site specific, and underline the need for standardizing the moisture conditions in soil structure quality assessment.},

abstract = {Understanding the vulnerability of tree species to anthropogenic threats is important for the efficient planning of restoration and conservation efforts. We quantified and compared the effects of future climate change and four current threats (fire, habitat conversion, overgrazing and overexploitation) on the 50 most common tree species of the tropical dry forests of northwestern Peru and southern Ecuador. We used an ensemble modelling approach to predict species distribution ranges, employed freely accessible spatial datasets to map threat exposures, and developed a trait-based scoring approach to estimate species-specific sensitivities, using differentiated trait weights in accordance with their expected importance in determining species sensitivities to specific threats. Species-specific vulnerability maps were constructed from the product of the exposure maps and the sensitivity estimates. We found that all 50 species face considerable threats, with an average of 46{\%} of species' distribution ranges displaying high or very high vulnerability to at least one of the five threats. Our results suggest that current levels of habitat conversion, overexploitation and overgrazing pose larger threats to most of the studied species than climate change. We present a spatially explicit planning strategy for species-specific restoration and conservation actions, proposing management interventions to focus on (a) in situ conservation of tree populations and seed collection for tree planting activities in areas with low vulnerability to climate change and current threats; (b) ex situ conservation or translocation of populations in areas with high climate change vulnerability; and (c) active planting or assisted regeneration in areas under high current threat vulnerability but low climate change vulnerability, provided that interventions are in place to lower threat pressure. We provide an online, user-friendly tool to visualize both the vulnerability maps and the maps indicating priority restoration and conservation actions.},

abstract = {Intercropping is a farming practice involving two or more crop species, or genotypes, growing together and coexisting for a time. On the fringes of modern intensive agriculture, intercropping is important in many subsistence or low-input/resource-limited agricultural systems. By allowing genuine yield gains without increased inputs, or greater stability of yield with decreased inputs, intercropping could be one route to delivering 'sustainable intensification'. We discuss how recent knowledge from agronomy, plant physiology and ecology can be combined with the aim of improving intercropping systems. Recent advances in agronomy and plant physiology include better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between crop genotypes and species - for example, enhanced resource availability through niche complementarity. Ecological advances include better understanding of the context-dependency of interactions, the mechanisms behind disease and pest avoidance, the links between above- and below-ground systems, and the role of microtopographic variation in coexistence. This improved understanding can guide approaches for improving intercropping systems, including breeding crops for intercropping. Although such advances can help to improve intercropping systems, we suggest that other topics also need addressing. These include better assessment of the wider benefits of intercropping in terms of multiple ecosystem services, collaboration with agricultural engineering, and more effective interdisciplinary research.},

abstract = {Agricultural advisory systems aim to improve livelihoods and well-being of the rural community by enhancing information exchange and capacity for collective action. In East Africa, advisory systems are becoming more demand driven and are being provided by an increasingly complex range of actors using participatory approaches. Social network analysis (SNA) provides a tool to examine farmer networks for broad assessment of agricultural advisory systems. This paper proposes a framework linking social network measures to information flow and capacity for collective action and applies it to personal (egocentric) networks in 11 sites within East Africa. The results provide valuable insight into performance of existing advisory systems and areas for improvement. Limited capacity for collective action, based on information networks, anecdotal evidence and literature, within farmer groups and communities was found in the Rwanda and to some degree in the Kenyan sites. In Tanzania, few connections with external information sources were found, potentially limiting new innovations entering the communities. In applying the framework, consideration of external factors that can influence social network structures is required so that attribution is not overstated. Use of egocentric networks and recall error challenges exist but can be managed. The proposed SNA framework provides a new and useful assessment tool, particularly combined with broader frameworks, for government agriculture ministries, development practitioners and researchers to support the design and assessment of agricultural advisory systems.},

The aim of this contribution is to evaluate the potential of video on mobile phones as a tool for farmer- to-farmer exchange and agricultural extension in Western Africa's rural reality. This aim was addressed by interviewing 460 farmers in Mali and Burkina Faso. Third generation (3G) mobile phones with video and Bluetooth technology were found to be widespread in the study area. Furthermore, videos on 3G phones were found to have a high frequency of contact and a high information utility. The participating farmers reported that 3G phones are readily accessible: including to people who had previously had limited access to information sources, such as young women. Video based information is particularly advantageous to illiterate farmers, and has potential to transform the typically top-down nature of information flow from extension agents to farmers. The farmers, in this case, hold ownership of video based information, which thereby extends its outreach. These findings allow the conclusions that video on mobile phones has tremendous potential as a tool for agricultural extension and farmer-to-farmer exchange in developing countries. The use of video on mobile phones is a novel approach to farmer-to-farmer exchange, which could contribute to transforming and amplifying extension efforts and thereby enabling the necessary intensification of land use, while also enabling more resilient, inclusive and democratic farming systems},

However, the choice of relevant soil attributes and interpretation of measurements are not straightforward, because of the complexity and site-specificity of soils, legacy effects of previous land use, and trade-offs between ecosystem services. Here we review soil quality and related concepts, in terms of definition, assessment approaches, and indicator selection and interpretation. We identify the most frequently used soil quality indicators under agricultural land use. We find that explicit evaluation of soil quality with respect to specific soil threats, soil functions and ecosystem services has rarely been implemented, and few approaches provide clear interpretation schemes of measured indicator values. This limits their adoption by land managers as well as policy. We also consider novel indicators that address currently neglected though important soil properties and processes, and we list the crucial steps in the development of a soil quality assessment procedure that is scientifically sound and supports management and policy decisions that account for the multi-functionality of soil. This requires the involvement of the pertinent actors, stakeholders and end-users to a much larger degree than practiced to date.},

abstract = {Soil acidity and phosphorus (P) deficiency are some of the major causes of low maize yields in Kenya. This study determined the immediate and residual effects of lime and P fertilizer on soil pH, exchangeable aluminium (Al), available P, maize grain yield, agronomic P use and P fertilizer recovery efficiencies on a western Kenya acid soil. The treatments were: P fertilizer (0, 26 and 52 kg P ha-1 as triple super phosphate) and lime (0, 2, 4 and 6 tons lime ha-1) applied once at the beginning of the study. A burnt liming material with 92.5{\%} calcium carbonate equivalent was used. Soil samples were analysed prior to and after treatment application. The site had low soil pH-H2O (4.9), available P (2.3 mg kg-1), total N (0.17{\%}), high Al (2.0 cmol kg-1 exchangeable Al and 29{\%} Al saturation). Lime reduced soil pH and exchangeable Al, leading to increased soil available P. Lime at 2, 4 and 6 tons ha-1 maintained soil pH ≥ 5.5 for 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively. The study observed that the recommended P fertilizer rate (26 kg P ha-1) for maize production in Kenya was inadequate to raise soil available P to the critical level (≥10 mg P kg -1 soil bicarbonate extractable P) required for healthy maize growth. To maintain soil available P at the critical level where 52 kg P ha -1 and combined 52 kg P ha-1 + 4 tons lime ha-1 were applied, it would be necessary to reapply the same P fertilizer rate after every one and two cropping seasons, respectively. The 4-year mean grain yield increments were 0.17, 0.34, 0.50, 0.58 and 1.17 tons ha-1 due to 2, 4, 6 tons lime ha-1, 26 kg P and 52 kg P ha-1, respectively. Both agronomic P use and P fertilizer recovery efficiencies increased with increasing rates of lime and decreased with increasing rates of P fertilizer. Therefore, combined applications of both lime and P fertilizer are important for enhancing maize production on P-deficient acid soils in western Kenya.

abstract = {Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, Second Edition, is divided into two basic parts, the first presenting R packages, functions, classes and methods for handling spatial data. This part is of interest to users who need to access and visualise spatial data. Data import and export for many file formats for spatial data are covered in detail, as is the interface between R and the open source GRASS GIS and the handling of spatio-temporal data. The second part showcases more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis, including spatial point pattern analysis, interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis and disease mapping. The coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques to new developments, and the examples used are largely taken from the spatial statistics literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed packages available from the CRAN website, with code and additional data sets from the book's own website. Compared to the first edition, the second edition covers the more systematic approach towards handling spatial data in R, as well as a number of important and widely used CRAN packages that have appeared since the first edition. This book will be of interest to researchers who intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse spatial data. It will also be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested in practical aspects of implementing software for spatial data analysis. It is a suitable companion book for introductory spatial statistics courses and for applied methods courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial data, including human and physical geography, geographical information science and geoinformatics, the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and disease control, economics, public administration and political science.},

abstract = {High-resolution digital soil mapping for applications like precision agriculture requires the collection of good-quality high spatial resolution information. Conventional soil analysis is expensive, time consuming and laborious. The development of proximal soil sensors to lessen the need for or to complement conventional soil analysis is important. Although proximal sensing may produce results that are not as accurate as conventional laboratory analysis, they allow for the collection of larger amounts of data using simpler, cheaper and less laborious techniques. This forms the rationale for proximal soil sensing. This article deals with indirect measurements of soil organic carbon (OC) and iron (Fe) contents using soil colour as the proxy. Measurements of soil colour were made using a digital camera. The RGB tristimuli were transformed to variables from other colour space models and a redness index (RI) and these were used to derive pedotransfer functions for soil OC and Fe. Predictions using univariate as well as full factorial regressions (FFR) of these tristimuli were compared to predictions using visible-near infrared (vis-NIR: 400-1100 nm) spectra with partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a reduced number of wavelengths selected using the variable importance for projection (VIP) with PLSR (VIP-PLSR). For predictions of soil OC content, the VIP-PLSR technique produced predictions with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.91 and 0.46{\%}. These were only very slightly better than predictions by an FFR of the CIELa*b* tristimuli (R2adj. of 0.91 and an RMSE of 0.48{\%}) and PLSR (R2adj. of 0.91 and an RMSE of 0.50{\%}). Predictions using the logarithmic regression of the CIEv* variable were least accurate with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.88 and 0.56{\%}. For predictions of Fe, an FFR of the CIELc*h* tristimuli produced an R2adj. of 0.71 and an RMSE of 0.068{\%}, which was better than those obtained by PLSR (R2adj. values of 0.64 and RMSE 0.074{\%}) and VIP-PLSR (R2adj. of 0.64 and 0.075{\%}). Predictions of Fe using the logarithmic regression of the RI produced the least accurate results with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.56 and 0.081{\%}. In this study, we showed that a digital camera can be used for fast, accurate and non-destructive measurements of soil colour and predictions of soil OC and Fe contents in Brittany, France. {\textcopyright} 2008 IAgrE.},

abstract = {African smallholder farming systems are complex, dynamic systems with many interacting biophysical subcomponents. In these systems the major inputs and outputs are managed by human agency - the farmers. To analyse potential developmental pathways of smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), we recognised the need for a tool that can capture the effects and consequences of decision-making on the use of resources. Here we describe and apply such a new modelling tool, developed within the NUANCES framework (Nutrient Use in ANimal and Cropping systems: Efficiencies and Scales), called NUANCES-FARMSIM (FARM SIMulator), an integrated crop - livestock model developed to analyse African smallholder farm systems. NUANCES-FARMSIM was used to analyse a representative case study farm in the highlands of Western Kenya, a site for which each of the components of FARMSIM has been thoroughly tested. We present the results of a sensitivity analysis which showed the model to be sufficiently robust to identify key management options that explain most of the variability in farm productivity, and the long-term consequences of these options for the case study farm. The analyses showed clearly that the most important decisions are those related to the interactions between the different components of the farm and therefore justify the need of integrating crop and livestock components within one modelling tool. The allocation of limited resources across the farm, and the way organic matter is recycled or redistributed within the farm determines the long-term production capacity of the system. The results of the sensitivity analyses further showed that for the case study farm in Western Kenya a strong focus on improving the reliability of the subsystem level or process descriptions will only result in minor improvement in simulating productivity at farm level. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods-random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression-as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56{\%} (coarse fragments) and 83{\%} (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61{\%}. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230{\%}. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base License.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE), defined as grain produced per unit of fertilizer N applied, is difficult to predict for specific maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes and environments because of possible significant interactions between different management practices (e.g., plant density and N fertilization rate or timing). The main research objective of this study was to utilize a quantitative framework to better understand the physiological mechanisms that govern N dynamics in maize plants at varying plant densities and N rates. Paired near-isogenic hybrids [i.e., with/without transgenic corn rootworm (Diabrotica sp.) resistance] were grown at two locations to investigate the individual and interacting effects of plant density (low-54,000; medium-79,000; and high-104,000plha-1) and sidedress N fertilization rate (low-0; medium-165; and high-330kgNha-1) on maize NUE and associated physiological responses. Total aboveground biomass (per unit area basis) was fractionated and both dry matter and N uptake were measured at four developmental stages (V14, R1, R3 and R6). Both plant density and N rate affected growth parameters and grain yield in this study, but hybrid effects were negligible. As expected, total aboveground biomass and N content were highly correlated at the V14 stage. However, biomass gain was not the only factor driving vegetative N uptake, for although N-fertilized maize exhibited higher shoot N concentrations than N-unfertilized maize, the former and latter had similar total aboveground biomass at V14. At the R1 stage, both plant density and N rate strongly impacted the ratio of total aboveground N content to green leaf area index (LAI), with the ratio declining with increases in plant density and decreases in N rate. Higher plant densities substantially increased pre-silking N uptake, but had relatively minor impact on post-silking N uptake for hybrids at both locations. Treatment differences for grain yield were more strongly associated with differences in R6 total biomass than in harvest index (HI) (for which values never exceeded 0.54). Total aboveground biomass accumulated between R1 and R6 rose with increasing plant density and N rate, a phenomenon that was positively associated with greater crop growth rate (CGR) and nitrogen uptake rate (NUR) during the critical period bracketing silking. Average NUE was similar at both locations. Higher plant densities increased NUE for both medium and high N rates, but only when plant density positively influenced both the N recovery efficiency (NRE) and N internal efficiency (NIE) of maize plants. Thus plant density-driven increases in N uptake by shoot and/or ear components were not enough, by themselves, to increase NUE. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Low and declining soil fertility has been recognized for a long time as a major impediment to intensifying agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Consequently, from the inception of international agricultural research, centres operating in SSA have had a research programme focusing on soil and soil fertility management, including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). The scope, content, and approaches of soil and soil fertility management research have changed over the past decades in response to lessons learnt and internal and external drivers and this paper uses IITA as a case study to document and analyse the consequences of strategic decisions taken on technology development, validation, and ultimately uptake by smallholder farmers in SSA. After an initial section describing the external environment within which soil and soil fertility management research is operating, various dimensions of this research area are covered: (i) ‘strategic research', ‘Research for Development', partnerships, and balancing acts, (ii) changing role of characterization due to the expansion in geographical scope and shift from soils to farms and livelihoods, (iii) technology development: changes in vision, content, and scale of intervention, (iv) technology validation and delivery to farming communities, and (v) impact and feedback to the technology development and validation process. Each of the above sections follows a chronological approach, covering the last five decades (from the late 1960s till today). The paper ends with a number of lessons learnt which could be considered for future initiatives aiming at developing and delivering improved soil and soil fertility management practices to smallholder farming communities in SSA.},

Here, we review bio-economic and bio-decision models, in which strategic and tactical decisions are included in dynamic adaptive and expectation-based processes, in 40 literature articles. The major points are: adaptability, flexibility, and dynamic processes are common ways to characterize farmers' decision-making. Adaptation is either a reactive or a proactive process depending on farmer flexibility and expectation capabilities. Various modeling methods are used to model decision stages in time and space, and some methods can be combined to represent a sequential decision-making process.},

abstract = {Fertilizer use in the semi-arid tropics is considered risky because of the unreliable rainfall pattern. A flexible system of fertilization was devised which allowed for high yields in wet years, and reduced financial losses in dry years. Relatively immobile nutrients, such as phosphorus, potassium and sulphur, were applied at rates determined from generalized soil properties and the total nutrient uptake required for a crop to achieve its maximum yield potential in a season with average rainfall. Nitrogen was applied as a series of split applications, which were adjusted during the season according to the degree of water stress observed. This approach was tested in on-farm trials for maize production on nutrient-poor sandy soils in three regions of Zimbabwe, and resulted in larger yields and profits than current recommendations, providing an accept able level of financial return. Small further yield increases were possible, at acceptable returns, when these fertilizer practices were combined with the establishment of tied-ridges by ox-drawn implements, 30 days after planting. By careful estimation of yield potential, and appropriate adjustments to soil fertility, this system of soil management could be applied to other cropping situations and other areas with variable rainfall. {\textcopyright} 1993, Cambridge University Press.

In real sense, it is the universal changes in the behavior of weather patterns based on statistical predictions for a long period of time. The region has experienced severe climatic changes of droughts, floods that negatively affect agricultural production causing food insecurity. This has caused both internal and regional migrations across East African borders especially by pastoral groups. These impelled migrations often cause insecurity. Literature searches have been used to gather information about what has been done and what should be done to safeguard communities from food insecurity caused by climate shocks. Results show that over 31{\%} of the people are affected by undernourishment, an indicator of food insecurity and this has been to a great extent brought about by destruction of ecosystems which has enhanced climate change. Proposed mitigation and adaptation strategies include traditional and non-traditional measures. Policy issues have also been emphasized. In conclusion, destruction of fragile ecosystems contributes to climate change. Failure to adopt new technologies and neglect of some traditional technologies are greatly responsible for food insecurity in East Africa.},

abstract = {Limited dispersal and connectivity in marine organisms can have negative fitness effects in populations that are small and isolated, but reduced genetic exchange may also promote the potential for local adaptation. Here, we compare the levels of genetic diversity and connectivity in the coral Montastraea cavernosa among both central and peripheral populations throughout its range in the Atlantic. Genetic data from one mitochondrial and two nuclear loci in 191 individuals show that M. cavernosa is subdivided into three genetically distinct regions in the Atlantic: Caribbean-North Atlantic, Western South Atlantic (Brazil) and Eastern Tropical Atlantic (West Africa). Within each region, populations have similar allele frequencies and levels of genetic diversity; indeed, no significant differentiation was found between populations separated by as much as 3000 km, suggesting that this coral species has the ability to disperse over large distances. Gene flow within regions does not, however, translate into connectivity across the entire Atlantic. Instead, substantial differences in allele frequencies across regions suggest that genetic exchange is infrequent between the Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa. Furthermore, markedly lower levels of genetic diversity are observed in the Brazilian and West African populations. Genetic diversity and connectivity may contribute to the resilience of a coral population to disturbance. Isolated peripheral populations may be more vulnerable to human impacts, disease or climate change relative to those in the genetically diverse Caribbean-North Atlantic region.},

abstract = {The Government of Nepal has identified opportunities in agricultural commercialization, responding to a growing internal demand and expansion of export markets to reduce the immense trade deficit. Several cash crops, including coffee and bananas, have been identified in the recently approved Agriculture Development Strategy. Both of these crops have encouraged smallholder farmers to convert their subsistence farming practices to more commercial cultivation. Identification of suitable agro-ecological zones and understanding climate-related issues are important for improved production and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Here, the suitability of coffee and banana crops is analyzed for different agro-ecological zones represented by Global Environmental Stratification (GEnS). Future shifts in these suitability zones are also predicted. Plantation sites in Nepal were geo-referenced and used as input in species distribution modelling. The multi-model ensemble model suggests that climate change will reduce the suitable growing area for coffee by about 72{\%} across the selected emission scenarios from now to 2050. Impacts are low for banana growing, with a reduction in suitability by about 16{\%} by 2050. Bananas show a lot of potential for playing an important role in Nepal as a sustainable crop in the context of climate change, as this study indicates that the amount of area suited to banana growing will grow by 40{\%} by 2050. Based on our analysis we recommend possible new locations for coffee plantations and one method for mitigating climate change-related problems on existing plantations. These findings are expected to support planning and policy dialogue for mitigation and support better informed and scientifically based decision-making relating to these two crops.},

abstract = {Termite-induced injuries to maize and baby corn were evaluated in on-going comparison experiments on organic and conventional farming systems at two trial sites in the Central Highlands of Kenya (Chuka and Thika). The farming systems were established in 2007 at two input levels: Low input level, representing subsistence farming (Conv-Low, Org-Low) and high input level, representing commercial farming (Conv-High, Org-High). Termite-induced injuries to maize and baby corn, such as tunneling the stem or lodging the whole plant were assessed over two cropping seasons. The lodging occurred exclusively at Thika. It first became apparent in the Org-Low system, with most of lodging occurring during the vegetative stage. Baby corn grown under high input systems showed increasing lodging from the late vegetative crop stage and peaked before the final harvest. Tunneling was recorded at both sites, but was generally below 5{\%}, with no significant differences between the farming systems. Overall, the injury patterns caused by termites appear to be a function of the plant growth stage, termite colony activities, trial site, and the types and levels of fertilizer input. Thus, the management practice used in each farming system (organic or conventional) might have greater influence on crop injuries than the type of farming system itself or the termite abundance within each system.},

abstract = {Background: Maize is the most produced crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, but yields are low and climate change is projected to further constrain smallholder production. The current efforts to breed and disseminate new high yielding and climate ready maize varieties are implemented through the formal seed system; the chain of public and private sector activities and institutions that produce and release certified seeds. These efforts are taking place in contexts currently dominated by informal seed systems; local and informal seed management and exchange channels with a long history of adapting crops to local conditions. We here present a case study of the genetic effects of both formal and informal seed management from the semi-arid zone in Tanzania. Results: Two open pollinated varieties (OPVs), Staha and TMV1, first released by the formal seed system in the 1980s are cultivated on two-thirds of the maize fields among the surveyed households. Farmer-recycling of improved varieties and seed selection are common on-farm seed management practices. Drought tolerance and high yield are the most important characteristics reported as reason for cultivating the current varieties as well as the most important criteria for farmers' seed selection. Bayesian cluster analysis, PCA and FST analyses based on 131 SNPs clearly distinguish between the two OPVs, and despite considerable heterogeneity between and within seed lots, there is insignificant differentiation between breeder's seeds and commercial seeds in both OPVs. Genetic separation increases as the formal system varieties enter the informal system and both hybridization with unrelated varieties and directional selection probably play a role in the differentiation. Using a Bayesian association approach we identify three loci putatively under selection in the informal seed system. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the formal seed system in the study area distributes seed lots that are true to type. We suggest that hybridization and directional selection differentiate farmer recycled seed lots from the original varieties and potentially lead to beneficial creolization. Access to drought tolerant OPVs in combination with farmer seed selection is likely to enhance seed system security and farmers' adaptive capacity in the face of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2014 Westengen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The large uncertainty in yield response to fertilizer application within smallholder cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) limits efforts aimed at intensifying crop production based on increased fertilizer application. We assessed the key field-scale cause of variability in maize (Zea mays) grain yield response to fertilizer nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the Sidindi area of Western Kenya based on past manure application, distance from the homestead, and clay and silt contents. We used data from nutrient omission trials conducted on 23 farms over seven consecutive cropping seasons covering the period 2013–2016, without changing treatments or plot location. Treatments included a control and PK, NK, NP and NPK. Accounting for past manure application increased the explained variability in maize yield, and yield response to N, P, and K application. Mean treatment maize grain yield in the control, PK, NK, NP and NPK treatments were 1.0, 2.2, 1.5, 2.9 and 4.5 t ha −1 at 88{\%} dry matter respectively in fields without past manure application, and 2.4, 2.7, 4.4, 4.9 and 5.4 t ha -1 in fields which had received animal manure in at least two out of three seasons prior to the start of the trials. Mean maize yield response to N, P and K application was 2.3, 3.0 and 1.6 t ha −1 respectively in fields without past manure application, and 2.8, 1.1 and 0.6 t ha −1 in fields with past manure application. In the seventh cropping season, past animal manure application contributed a fertilizer equivalent of 28.3, 29.8 and 31.5 kg ha −1 of N, P and K, respectively. At both the onset and at the start of the last season, fields with past animal manure application had on average higher contents of SOC, available P and exchangeable K, yet differences were not always significant within treatments. Accounting for past animal manure application reduces crop fertilizer requirements for P and K as well as decreasing uncertainty in yield response to fertilizer. We conclude that the strong influence of past animal manure application on yield response to fertilizer application merits the inclusion of past manure application as a co-variate in analysis of yield response data from smallholder cropping systems of SSA.},

In this study, we incorporated Sentinel-2 satellite data into an increment-based measure of forest productivity (biomass growth index (BGI) derived from climate, lithology, soils, and topographic metrics to map improved BGI (iBGI) in parts of North American Acadian regions. Initially, several Sentinel-2 variables including nine single spectral bands and 12 spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were used in combination with forest management variables to predict tree volume/ha and height using Random Forest. The results showed a 10-12 {\%} increase in out of bag (OOB) r2 when Sentinel-2 variables were included in the prediction of both volume and height together with BGI. Later, selected Sentinel-2 variables were used for biomass growth prediction in Maine, USA and New Brunswick, Canada using data from 7738 provincial permanent sample plots. The Sentinel-2 red-edge position (S2REP) index was identified as the most important variable over others to have known influence on site productivity. While a slight improvement in the iBGI accuracy occurred compared to the base BGI model ({\~{}}2{\%}), substantial changes to coefficients of other variables were evident and some site variables became less important when S2REP was included.},

abstract = {Small-scale cereal farmers dominate agricultural activities in developing countries. These agricultural activities are characterized by low productivity due to lack of agricultural input information. This lack is restrained by the low use of ICTs caused by some factors such as the farmers' perception of ICTs and the ICTs' delivered information quality. We investigated these factors and their effects on ICTs' use by small-scale cereal farmers in developing countries. Sikasso region in Mali was selected as a case. A convenient sample size of 300 cereal farmers was selected. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique was used to analyse the data. The results suggested that the perception i.e. relative advantage, compatibility and simplicity and the delivered information quality were able to explain 77.9{\%} of the variance in the Use of ICTs to access and use agricultural input information. From these results, it is important to take the Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Simplicity and Information Quality as the main factors determining the use of ICTs in developing countries in the cereal production context. A further line of inquiry could be to gather data from other developing countries to validate or find out more factors in such settings.},

abstract = {Mineral fertiliser is a scarce input for smallholder maize farmers in Malawi. A recent provision of small amounts of subsidised fertilisers by government programmes to farmers throughout Malawi has increased fertiliser access and raised maize production, but fertiliser management and yield responses frequently remain poor. To seek ways to use the fertiliser more efficiently, we analysed the effects of low rates of N (15 or 30 kg N ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and P (9 kg P ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) fertiliser in combination with improved weed management on maize yields in experiments on 12 smallholder farms in Chisepo, central Malawi. Several indices of N and P use efficiency were computed from the above-ground crop components and nutrient contents. Maize yield simulations were conducted using long-term rainfall records in the APSIM crop-soil system model. NP fertiliser significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) raised maize grain yield from 0.65 to 1.5 t ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and twice-weeding fertilised maize significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) raised maize yields by 0.4 t ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} compared with weeding once (0.9 t ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). The agronomic efficiency of applied fertiliser N (AEN) averaged 19.3 kg grain kg N{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} with one weeding but doubled to 38.7 kg with the additional weeding. The physiological efficiency of applied N (PEN) was 40.7 kg grain kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} N uptake. APSIM predicted that similar or larger maize yield responses to 15 or 30 kg N ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} can be expected in 8 out of 10 years in areas with similar rainfall patterns to Chisepo. A financial analysis showed that the application of these small amounts of fertiliser was economic even when fertiliser was purchased from the open market, provided the crop was adequately weeded. Participatory assessments helped farmers understand the increased efficiency of fertiliser use possible with additional weeding, although some farmers reported difficulty implementing this recommendation due to competing demands for labour. We conclude that to raise the productivity and sustainability of fertiliser support programmes in Malawi, initiatives should be introduced to help identify and educate farmers on the major drivers of productivity in their systems.},

abstract = {Belowground competition occurs when plants decrease the growth, survival, or fecundity of neighbors by reducing available soil resources. Competition belowground can be stronger and involve many more neighbors than aboveground competition. Physiological ecologists and population or community ecologists have traditionally studied belowground competition from different perspectives. Physiologically based studies often measure resource uptake without determining the integrated consequences for plant performance, while population or community level studies examine plant performance but fail to identify the resource intermediary or mechanism. Belowground competitive ability is correlated with such attributes as root density, surface area, and plasticity either in root growth or in the properties of enzymes involved in nutrient uptake. Unlike competition for light, in which larger plants have a disproportionate advantage by shading smaller ones, competition for soil resources is apparently more symmetric. Belowground competition often decreases with increases in nutrient levels, but it is premature to generalize about the relative importance of above- and belowground competition across resource gradients. Although shoot and root competition are often assumed to have additive effects on plant growth, some studies provide evidence to the contrary, and potential interactions between the two forms of competition should be considered in future investigations. Other research recommendations include the simultaneous study of root and shoot gaps, since their closures may not occur simultaneously, and improved estimates of the belowground neighborhood. Only by combining the tools and perspectives from physiological ecology and population and community biology can we fully understand how soil characteristics, neighborhood structure, and global climate change influence or are influenced by plant competition belowground.},

This part is of interest to users who need to access and visualise spatial data. Data import and export for many file formats for spatial data are covered in detail, as is the interface between R and the open source GRASS GIS and the handling of spatio-temporal data. The second part showcases more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis, including spatial point pattern analysis, interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis and disease mapping. The coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques to new developments, and the examples used are largely taken from the spatial statistics literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed packages available from the CRAN website, with code and additional data sets from the book's own website. Compared to the first edition, the second edition covers the more systematic approach towards handling spatial data in R, as well as a number of important and widely used CRAN packages that have appeared since the first edition. This book will be of interest to researchers who intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse spatial data. It will also be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested in practical aspects of implementing software for spatial data analysis. It is a suitable companion book for introductory spatial statistics courses and for applied methods courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial data, including human and physical geography, geographical information science and geoinformatics, the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and disease control, economics, public administration and political science.},

abstract = {Cropping sequence diversification provides a systems approach to reduce yield variations and improve resilience to multiple environmental stresses. Yield advantages of more diverse crop rotations and their synergistic effects with reduced tillage are well documented, but few studies have quantified the impact of thesemanagement practices on yields and their stability when soil moisture is limiting or in excess. Using yield and weather data obtained from a 31-year long term rotation and tillage trial in Ontario, we tested whether crop rotation diversity is associated with greater yield stability when abnormal weather conditions occur. We used parametric and non-parametric approaches to quantify the impact of rotation diversity (monocrop, 2-crops, 3- crops without or with one or two legume cover crops) and tillage (conventional or reduced tillage) on yield probabilities and the benefits of crop diversity under different soil moisture and temperature scenarios. Although the magnitude of rotation benefits varied with crops, weather patterns and tillage, yield stability significantly increased when corn and soybean were integrated into more diverse rotations. Introducing small grains into short corn-soybean rotation was enough to provide substantial benefits on long-term soybean yields and their stability while the effects on corn weremostly associated with the temporal niche provided by small grains for underseeded red clover or alfalfa. Crop diversification strategies increased the probability of harnessing favorable growing conditions while decreasing the risk of crop failure. In hot and dry years, diversification of corn-soybean rotations and reduced tillage increased yield by 7{\%} and 22{\%}for corn and soybean respectively. Given the additional advantages associated with cropping system diversification, such a strategy provides a more comprehensive approach to lowering yield variability and improving the resilience of cropping systems tomultiple environmental stresses. This could help to sustain future yield levels in challenging production environments.},

abstract = {African farming systems are highly heterogeneous: between agroecological and socioeconomic environments, in the wide variability in farmers' resource endowments and in farm management. This means that single solutions (or 'silver bullets') for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems - Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. NUANCES offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term 'best-fit' technologies - technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The NUANCES framework is not 'just another computer model'! We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through 'maintenance fertilization' from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies - both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a rare but important exception, Ethiopia's agriculture sector recorded remarkable rapid growth during 2004–14. This paper explores this rapid change in the agriculture sector of this important country – the second most populous in Africa. We review the evidence on agricultural growth and decompose the contributions of modern inputs to growth using an adjusted Solow decomposition model. We also highlight the key pathways Ethiopia followed to achieve its agricultural growth. We find that land and labor use expanded significantly and total factor productivity grew by about 2.3{\%} per year over the study period. Moreover, modern input use more than doubled, explaining some of this growth. The expansion in modern input use appears to have been driven by high government expenditures on the agriculture sector, including agricultural extension, but also by an improved road network, higher rural education levels, and favorable international and local price incentives.},

Here, we apply functional ecology to five agricultural landscapes in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, and ask to what extent vegetation characteristics contribute to soil functions that are key to farmers' livelihoods. We used the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF), a multi-scale assessment of land health. Each LDSF site is a 10 × 10 km landscape in which vegetation cover and erosion prevalence were measured, a tree inventory was carried out, and topsoil (0–20 cm) samples were collected for organic carbon (SOC) analysis in approximately 160 × 1,000 m2 plots. Land degradation is a recurring phenomenon across the five landscapes, indicated by high erosion prevalence (67{\%}–99{\%} of the plots were severely eroded). We used mixed models to assess if vegetation cover, above-ground woody biomass and the functional properties of woody vegetation (weighted-mean trait values, functional diversity [FD]) explain variation in SOC and erosion prevalence. We found that the vegetation cover and above-ground biomass had strong positive effects on soil health by increasing SOC and reducing soil erosion. After controlling for cover and biomass, we found additional marginal effects of functional properties where FD was positively associated with SOC and the abundance of invasive species was associated with higher soil erosion. Synthesis and applications. This work illustrates how functional ecology can provide much-needed evidence for designing strategies to restore degraded agricultural land and the ecosystem services on which farmers depend. We show that to ensure soil health, it is vital to avoid exposed soil, maintain or promote tree cover, while ensuring functional diversity of tree species, and to eradicate invasive species.},

abstract = {Mineral nturient defiencies are a major constraint limiting legume nitrogen fixation and yield. In this review general techniques for assessing nutrient involvement in symbiotic nitrogen fixation are described and specific methods are outlined for determining which developmental phase of the symbiosis is most sensitive to nutrient deficiency. The mineral nutrition of the Rhizobium component of the symbiosis is considered both as the free living organism in the soil and as bacteroids in root nodules. Rhizobial growth and survival in soils is not usually limited by nutrient availability. Multiplication of rhizobia in the legume rhizosphere is limited by low Ca availability. Nodule initiation is affected by severe Co deficiency through effects on rhizobia. Nodule development is limited by severe B deficiency via an effect on plant cell growth. Fe deficiency limits nodule development by affecting rhizobia and strains of rhizobia differ widely in their ability to acquire sufficient Fe for their symbiotic development. Nodule function requires more Mo than does the host plant, and in some symbioses nitrogen fixation may be specifically limited by low availability of Ca, Co, Cu and Fe. The importance of the peribacteriod membrane in determining nutrient availability to bacteroids is considered. It is concluded that the whole legume-Rhizobium symbiosis should be considered when improving legume growth and yield under nutrient stress conditions. Differences among rhizobial strains in their ability to obtain mineral nutrients from their environment may be agronomically important. {\textcopyright} 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Agriculture is generally referred to as the mainstay of African economy, the real driver of economic growth. Agricultural extension plays a critical role in African development by bringing the farming community information on new technologies, which they can adopt to increase productivity, incomes and standards of living. Therefore, extension staffs are key players in the development process. However, extension systems in Africa face numerous challenges, which, in turn limit their effectiveness in promoting smallholder farmers' productivity. This study by an emerging Africa Extension Reform Group ({\{}AERG{\}}) was carried out to determine issues and challenges facing extension personnel in Africa. The researchers interviewed 393 extension staffs at the district, sub-district and grass root levels in nine countries, namely, Ghana, Botswana, Tanzania, Cameroon, Senegal, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Nigeria. Although the study is not generalizable to Africa or even the countries of study, it does help identify critical issues and challenges facing extension in Africa. The study looked at issues, such as job satisfaction; use of Information and Communication Technologies, types of extension methods practiced; and communication and other training needs. The researchers found that the challenges of extension were similar across countries, suggesting that a common solution was possible. In particular, the study found that in addition to their training in agriculture extension agents need training in development and communication to help them cope with the increasing sophistication of development in programming. The findings call for re-thinking the reformation of extension at two levels: a) re-examining extension training at the university level; and b) re-positioning extension in the field such that it serves as a neutral facilitator of development across sectors. At the moment, extension systems are so married with agriculture that other sectors do not see them as un-biased knowledge facilitators.},

abstract = {Western Kenya is one of Africa's most densely populated rural areas, characterised by intensive smallholder crop-livestock systems on degraded lands managed with small inputs of mineral fertiliser and animal manure. Competing uses for crop residues and other organic resources often results in poor nutrient cycling efficiencies at farm scale. Modifying livestock feeding, retaining more crop residues in the field, and improving manure management can help conserving considerable amount of nutrients on-farm. To examine to what extent such strategies would be feasible, we analysed whole-farm nutrient cycling efficiencies (NCE) of a range of farms differing in resource-endowment and production orientation, identifying the most efficient farmer strategies considering labour and financial constraints. Nutrient concentration in excreted cattle manure was relatively small (i.e., N{\textless}1.7{\%}; P{\textless}0.6{\%}). Current manure management practices led to low NCE's (average 27{\%}) due to nutrient losses from excretion through storage and application. Farmers have few incentives to improve manure management given the small amounts of excreta and nutrients to be recycled. Yet, manure, both composted and fresh, represented the greatest N (16kgha-1 season-1) and C returns to the soil (312kg C ha-1 season-1). Retention of crop residues was the cheapest source of nutrient inputs for the next crop, especially when compared with manure, but farmers prioritised its use for cattle feeding. Our findings highlight the critical lack of nutrients and organic residues on smallholder farms in the densely-populated highlands of East Africa, as well as low NCE when it comes to manure. In these conditions, efficient nutrient cycling for manure and improved cattle feeding are essential to increase use efficiencies of any possible external nutrient added in these farms.},

abstract = {RothC and Century are two of the most widely used soil organic matter (SOM) models. However there are few examples of specific parameterisation of these models for environmental conditions in East Africa. The aim of this study was therefore, to evaluate the ability of RothC and the Century to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) resulting from varying land use/management practices for the climate and soil conditions found in Kenya. The study used climate, soils and crop data from a long term experiment (1976-2001) carried out at The Kabete site at The Kenya National Agricultural Research Laboratories (NARL, located in a semi-humid region) and data from a 13 year experiment carried out in Machang'a (Embu District, located in a semi-arid region). The NARL experiment included various fertiliser (0, 60 and 120 kg of N and P2O5 ha-1), farmyard manure (FYM-5 and 10 t ha-1) and plant residue treatments, in a variety of combinations. The Machang'a experiment involved a fertiliser (51 kg N ha-1) and a FYM (0, 5 and 10 t ha-1) treatment with both monocropping and intercropping. At Kabete both models showed a fair to good fit to measured data, although Century simulations for treatments with high levels of FYM were better than those without. At the Machang'a site with monocrops, both models showed a fair to good fit to measured data for all treatments. However, the fit of both models (especially RothC) to measured data for intercropping treatments at Machang'a was much poorer. Further model development for intercrop systems is recommended. Both models can be useful tools in soil C predictions, provided time series of measured soil C and crop production data are available for validating model performance against local or regional agricultural crops. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, a formal test of intra-household commitment is derived and performed. To that end, two models of household intertemporal behaviour are developed. In both models, household members are characterized by individual preferences. In the first formulation, household decisions are always on the ex ante Pareto frontier. In the second model, the assumption of intra-household commitment required by ex ante efficiency is relaxed. It is shown that the full-efficiency household Euler equations are nested in the no-commitment Euler equations. Using this result, the hypothesis that household members can commit to future allocations of resources is tested using the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I strongly reject this hypothesis. It is also shown that the standard unitary framework is a special case of the full-efficiency model. However, if household members are not able to commit, household intertemporal behaviour cannot be characterized using the standard life-cycle model. These findings have two main implications. First, policy makers can change household behaviour by modifying the decision power of individual household members. Second, to evaluate programmes designed to improve the welfare of household members, it would be beneficial to replace the standard unitary model with a characterization of household behaviour that allows for lack of commitment. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

abstract = {Intensification of smallholder agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa is necessary to address rural poverty and natural resource degradation. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is a means to enhance crop productivity while maximizing the agronomic efficiency (AE) of applied inputs, and can thus contribute to sustainable intensification. ISFM consists of a set of best practices, preferably used in combination, including the use of appropriate germplasm, the appropriate use of fertilizer and of organic resources, and good agronomic practices. The large variability in soil fertility conditions within smallholder farms is also recognized within ISFM, including soils with constraints beyond those addressed by fertilizer and organic inputs. The variable biophysical environments that characterize smallholder farming systems have profound effects on crop productivity and AE, and targeted application of agro-inputs and management practices is necessary to enhance AE. Further, management decisions depend on the farmer's resource endowments and production objectives. In this paper we discuss the “local adaptation” component of ISFM and how this can be conceptualized within an ISFM framework, backstopped by analysis of AE at plot and farm level. At plot level, a set of four constraints to maximum AE is discussed in relation to “local adaptation”: soil acidity, secondary nutrient and micronutrient (SMN) deficiencies, physical constraints, and drought stress. In each of these cases, examples are presented whereby amendments and/or practices addressing these have a significantly positive impact on fertilizer AE, including mechanistic principles underlying these effects. While the impact of such amendments and/or practices is easily understood for some practices (e.g. the application of SMNs where these are limiting), for others, more complex processes influence AE (e.g. water harvesting under varying rainfall conditions). At farm scale, adjusting fertilizer applications to within-farm soil fertility gradients has the potential to increase AE compared with blanket recommendations, in particular where fertility gradients are strong. In the final section, “local adaption” is discussed in relation to scale issues and decision support tools are evaluated as a means to create a better understanding of complexity at farm level and to communicate appropriate scenarios for allocating agro-inputs and management practices within heterogeneous farming environments.},

We apply a combination of econometric approaches to a nationally representative, balanced panel of smallholder maize-growing households, and invoke the chain rule to generate quantitative estimates of impacts per kilogram of subsidized seed. Our findings demonstrate that in the initial years of the program, subsidized seed enhanced the well-being of smallholder maize growers according to each indicator, but by small magnitudes.

abstract = {Soil acidity is one property associated with decline of most crop productivity. Alfisols and Ultisols are some of the acidic soils predominant in western Kenya. An experiment was conducted in both soils to find out the effect of farmyard manure (FYM) and inorganic fertilizers on maize yield on farmers' fields during wet and dry seasons of 2006. The experiment, laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD), had five replications in each soil type. The treatments were: farmer's practice, N (60 kg ha-1), NP (60 kg ha-1 of each), NPK (60 kg ha-1 of each N and P; K 40 kg ha-1), FYM+30 kg N ha-1, and optimal fertilizer (N, 200; P, 60; K, 120; Mg, 20; B, 5 kg ha-1). During wet season, all treatments in Alfisols gave nearly double grain yield compared to Ultisols. In both soils, during the same season, except for optimal fertilizer, FYM was not significantly (P≤0.05) different from other inorganic fertilizer treatments on plant population, height, cob number, stover, grain yield and 100-seed weight. FYM had a 108{\%} and 103{\%} grain yield advantage over farmer's treatment in Alfisols and Ultisols, respectively. During dry season, plant population, number of cobs and grain yield were higher in Ultisols compared to Alfisols. In each soil type, FYM plus 30 kg N ha-1 provided maize grain yield equivalent to that of N, NP and NPK treatments. FYM had a 4{\%} grain yield advantage over optimal and NPK treatments on Ultisols during dry season. We conclude that larger amount of fertilizers or liming is needed on Ultisols to enhance their productivity to the level of Alfisols and that due to the fact that smallholder farmers are not likely to afford large amount of fertilizer and liming, use of FYM is their best bet for maize production on both Alfisols and Ultisols as there is no significant yield advantage from N, NP or NPK over FYM. Ultisols appear to be more responsive to FYM during dry season probably due to prevailing higher temperatures and relatively dry soil which enhances faster mineralization of organic matter to available plant nutrients. Addition of N fertilizer failed to increase yield in Ultisols, probably due to decline in soil pH and consequently inefficient utilization of applied resources.},

abstract = {For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.},

This research aimed to understand farmers' tree planting priorities in Oromia, Ethiopia and address challenges involved in meeting them. Tree species and planting niches were elicited through focus group discussions. Participatory trials compared 17 tree species across seven on-farm planting niches and seedling survival and growth patterns were evaluated. Farmers suggested a high diversity of tree species suitable for each niche with fruit species mainly selected for homesteads. The diversity of desired tree species is much higher than that typically available in nurseries or promoted by tree planting projects. Meeting planting demands was difficult because the existing seedling supply does not support diversity. Evaluation of tree survival showed striking differences among species, farms, agroecologies and planting niches. There was high variation in seedling survival amongst the tree species planted on 1893 farm/planting niche locations, indicating impact of local level risk factors attributable to management, biotic and abiotic causes. Growth differences of the six shared species common to both agroecologies across different niches, showed that the effects of species and niche were significant on growth. A farmer-led approach to increasing tree cover that couples understanding of species and planting niche preferences with appropriate seedling supply and management is proposed as a means to increase the diversity of trees in farmed landscapes.},

abstract = {Widespread implementation of conservation agriculture (CA) in North and South America and Australia suggests significant farmer profitability achieved through some combination of sustained or increased agronomic productivity and reduced input costs. Many believe similar agronomic benefits can accrue to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA) for a broad array of crops and farming systems despite marked differences in biophysical and socio-economic environments across these regions. Our objectives were to characterize (1) the quality of existing research including an assessment of the relevance of previously published reviews and surveys to SSA and SA, and (2) the empirical evidence from SSA and SA for agronomic benefits derived from implementing zero tillage (ZT) including the identification of knowledge gaps. Mulching and rotation were considered as associated practices within systems. Among surveys and reviews, most syntheses of multiple, independent studies were either entirely qualitative or used overly simplistic approaches to data aggregation. Few reviews used meta-analysis or other rigorous statistics that permit assessment of outcome sensitivity to influential observations; in general, review protocol descriptions were not sufficient to ensure transparency and appropriate handling of common biases. A search and screening of peer-reviewed literature identified empirical studies on conservation tillage in SSA and SA for maize (22), rice (16), cowpea (10) and sorghum (8). In attempting to extract data for an unbiased, systematic review of CA and maize, we found few studies fully reported critical data or meta-data; most common omissions were the univariate statistics required for study use in meta-analyses and critical supporting or explanatory data on soil type, prevailing weather, and management practices including handling of crop residues. In the short-term, ZT generally resulted in lower yields than with conventional tillage (CT). Occasionally these reductions could be linked to direct effects (e.g. increased soil compaction in rice), but failure to adapt other managements (e.g. weed control) to the CA system was a common and confounding indirect effect. Sufficient maize data existed to demonstrate that negative impacts on yield ameliorated with time in some cases accompanied by higher soil water infiltration and soil organic matter, particularly when mulch was added. However, the low number of studies, the missing supporting data and the large variation in treatments made it difficult to infer general direct effects due to mulching or rotation.Well-designed long-term experiments on CA featuring sound agronomic practice and comprehensive documentation are largely missing from the literature. Future systematic reviews addressing agronomic impacts of CA interventions will require appropriate handling of within and between study variance as well as sensitivity analyses and quantitative assessments of publication bias; on-going and future empirical studies must report a minimum dataset encompassing valid statistical measures and comprehensive intervention descriptions that enable standardization and systematic approaches in syntheses. We propose a minimum dataset that is generic to competent agronomy with measurements that are increasingly low-cost and easy to achieve and should therefore be routine in field experiments quantifying and explaining crop and cropping system performance. Until a larger number of field studies provide such quantifying and explanatory data from key crops and representative cropping systems, it is not possible to make strong general conclusions about benefits of CA and ZT on yields and resource use efficiency of smallholder farmers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Citizen science is the involvement of citizens, such as farmers, in the research process. Citizen science has become increasingly popular recently, supported by the proliferation of mobile communication technologies such as smartphones. However, citizen science methodologies have not yet been widely adopted in agricultural research. Here, we conducted an online survey with 57 British and French farmers in 2014. We investigated (1) farmer ownership and use of smartphone technologies, (2) farmer use of farm-specific management apps, and (3) farmer interest and willingness to participate in agricultural citizen science projects. Our results show that 89 {\%} respondents owned a smartphone, 84 {\%} used it for farm management, and 72 {\%} used it on a daily basis. Fifty-nine percent engaged with farm-specific apps, using on average four apps. Ninety-three percent respondents agreed that citizen science was a useful methodology for data collection, 93 {\%} for real-time monitoring, 83 {\%} for identification of research questions, 72 {\%} for experimental work, and 72 {\%} for wildlife recording. Farmers also showed strong interest to participate in citizen science projects, often willing to commit substantial amounts of time. For example, 54 {\%} of British respondents were willing to participate in farmland wildlife recording once a week or monthly. Although financial support was not always regarded as necessary, experimental work was the most likely activity for which respondents thought financial support would be essential. Overall, this is the first study to quantify and explore farmers' use of smartphones for farm management, and document strong support for farm-based citizen science projects.},

abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), traditional farming methods have led to severe nutrient depletion, low crop yields, and poverty, leaving many farm families disappointed. The situation is aggravated by low use of fertilizers by farmers, lack of policy and institutional support, weak fertilizer markets, farmers' lack of access to credit and inputs, inappropriate fertilizer packaging sizes, deteriorating soil science capacity, and weak agricultural extension. This leads to a huge gap between the actual and potential crop yields and widespread poverty. Opportunities, options, and innovations are available to turn around this situation and reduce poverty in Africa. We reviewed the status of agricultural soils of sub-Saharan Africa, the factors contributing to their current status, and the existing and emerging opportunities for addressing the soil fertility challenges. The major points are (1) the soils in SSA have continued to be characterized by huge and widespread negative nutrient imbalances and low productivity, and (2) the factors contributing to declining soil fertility in Africa are not abating. The way forward includes: balanced fertilization; input-output market development; improved crop management, and the use of nutrient budgets to inform policy and ensure that farmers and other land managers enjoy the profitable use of farm inputs including mineral fertilizers and agro-minerals. {\textcopyright} INRA - DIB / Springer-Verlag France 2011.},

abstract = {In the Gash Delta of Eastern Sudan, spate irrigation (flood-recession farming) contributes substantially to rural livelihoods by providing better yields than rainfed dryland farming. However, spate irrigation farmers are challenged by the unpredictability of flooding. In recent decades, the number of farmers practicing spate irrigation has decreased, due to varying rainfall intensity and frequency, insufficient infrastructure and farmers' limited capacity to manage such variations. One solution that may help farmers face such challenges is for them to access real-time water-related information by using smart Information and Communication a Technology (ICT). This paper shows how integrating remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), flood-forecasting models and communication platforms can, in near real time, alert smallholder farmers and relevant government departments about incoming floods, using the Gash basin of Sudan as an example. The Ministry of Water Resources of Sudan used the findings of this study to transform farmers' responses to flood arrival from being ‘reactive' to planning for the flood event. Intensive on-site and institutional efforts to build the capacity of farmers, farmer organizations, development departments and officers of the Ministry helped to develop the initiative from simply sending ‘emergency alerts' to enabling stakeholders to visually see the flood event unfolding in the region and to plan accordingly for storing water, operating spate-irrigation systems and undertaking cropping activities. The research, initially conducted on a 60 × 60 km site, was later extended to the entire Gash basin. The paper outlines how to develop tools that can monitor plot-specific information from satellite measurements, and supply detailed and specific information on crops, rather than providing very general statements on crop growth. Farmers are able to use such tools to optimize their farm profits by providing water to their crops in the right place, at the right time and in the right quantity. Finally, the work demonstrates the high potential of combining technology, namely remote sensing data and simple a agro-meteorological model with limited parameters, for large-scale monitoring of spate irrigation systems and information sharing to advise farmers as to how to apply this information to their managerial decisions.},

abstract = {The benefits provided by underutilised fruit tree species such as baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in combating increasing malnutrition and poverty become more apparent as awareness grows regarding concerns of climate change and food security. Due to its multiple uses, its high nutritional and medicinal value, drought tolerance and relatively easy cultivation, baobab has been identified as one of the most important edible forest trees to be conserved, domesticated and valued in Africa. In order to contribute towards the cultivation of the species, suitability of sites in Africa and worldwide was evaluated for potential cultivation using species' locality data and spatial environmental data in MAXENT modelling framework. A total of 450 geo-referenced records of the baobab tree were assembled from herbarium records, commercial firm's databases and fieldwork for modelling site suitability for global cultivation of the baobab tree. Climatic and topographic data were acquired from the Worldclim data while soil data was obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database. MAXENT was found to be a successful modelling method for studying cultivation potential. The main variables that contributed towards predicting baobab's global cultivation potential were annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. Results suggest that baobab tree could be widely cultivated in most countries in southern Africa and in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan. Angola and Somalia were found to be highly suitable for cultivating baobab in Africa. Model suggests, India, where the baobab tree already exists and is used, to be the most suitable country for baobab cultivation outside Africa. North-west Australia, Madagascar, north-east Brazil and Mexico resulted to be other suitable places for cultivating the tree species. Although it is recommended model results be validated with in situ seedling experiments, there seems to be a great potential for the cultivation of this species globally. {\textcopyright}2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Soil fertility is vital for agricultural productivity, yet poor soils and erosion remain a management challenge in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. One challenge is that soil scientists and farmers often evaluate soil fertility using different knowledge systems and the implications have not been clearly reconciled within the literature. In particular, whether farmers are observing similar aspects of structure and function as classified in soil science. If so, what can we learn about how soil fertility is evaluated and communicated in terms of developing a hybrid approach that improves communication of ideas between different stakeholders. This paper addresses this challenge by examining the similarities and differences between farmers' qualitative evaluation and soil science quantitative analysis for soil fertility classification, and how location of soils influence farmers' evaluation of soil fertility. Empirical fieldwork was carried out in two villages in Kitui County, Kenya with 60 farmers using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussion. Based on farmer perception, 116 soil samples of the best and worst soil fertility taken and analysed for physiochemical factors. Farmers had a consistent classification system and primarily relied on texture and colour as indicators for good soil fertility and texture alone for poor soils. Soils with fine texture under the local semi-arid climate were associated with higher pH, TOC and WHC and fertile black and red soils were associated with pH, TOC, WHC and AP based on differences in bed rock. Poor soil fertility was associated with sandy soils and soils with no colour in their local name. Spatial location is an important consideration in farmers' evaluations, reflecting awareness of local diversity in soil and historical social or environmental factors. Local historical narratives reveal the importance in changes to humus, consistent with technical knowledge about the role of soil organic matter for soil fertility. The paper provides a better understanding of farmers' soil classification, evaluation processes and perspectives that help to inform scientists working with alternative frameworks for assessment and, in doing so, supports the development of local tailor-made soil assessment systems.},

These tools can lead users through clear steps and suggest optimal decision paths or may act more as information sources to improve the evidence base for decisions. Yet, despite their availability in a wide range of formats, studies in several countries have shown uptake to be disappointingly low. This paper uses a mixed methods approach to investigate the factors affecting the uptake and use of decision support tools by farmers and advisers in the UK. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys, we found that fifteen factors are influential in convincing farmers and advisers to use decision support tools, which include usability, cost-effectiveness, performance, relevance to user, and compatibility with compliance demands. This study finds a plethora of agricultural decision support tools in operation in the UK, yet, like other studies, shows that their uptake is low. A better understanding of the fifteen factors identified should lead to more effective design and delivery of tools in the future.},

abstract = {Emerging trends of a changing and increasingly variable climate have introduced new livelihood challenges in rain-fed smallholder agricultural systems that predominate in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The capacity of local farming communities and their institutions to respond to the new and emerging impacts of climate change is often constrained by lack of access to information and improved technologies, as well as poor support mechanisms to promote assimilation of new knowledge. This threatens to heighten vulnerability of the majority of SSA's rural communities who are already facing severe problems of food insecurity and a declining soil resource base. In this paper we use two case studies from Wenchi district in Ghana and Makoni in Zimbabwe to communicate how participatory action research (PAR) methodology, characterised by iterative planning-action-reflection cycles, was coupled with a new concept of field-based farmer learning centres to build adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers to climate change. The study was part of a University of Zimbabwe-led project supported under the Climate Change Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) programme to explore the state of resilience in African smallholder farming. The PAR and learning centre processes enabled communities, local leaders, and extension agents and researchers to establish the, hither to, imperceptible link between poor soil fertility and rising institutional challenges within communities. Institutional conflicts related to land tenure and sharecropping arrangements between migrant farmers and native landowners were addressed in Ghana, while local institutions supporting traditional social safety net mechanisms were revitalized in Zimbabwe. In both cases, it was apparent that farmers faced multiple stresses, at the core of which were poor and declining soil fertility and weakening local institutions. The worsening rainfall distribution and increasing cases of drought are broadening the scope for vulnerability, often driving competing claims and conflicts. PAR was successfully used as an entry point, empowering communities to self-mobilize and self-organize to co-learn and experiment with integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies and other improved farming practices. They realised opportunities for achieving high crop yields and generate surpluses in good years. Strengthening local institutional capacity to revitalise community safety nets proved an essential ingredient for enhancing adaptive capacity of smallholders to climatic shocks. The PAR process was a major driver of effective partnerships among community members, extension, policy makers and researchers, but ensuing success generated a new set of social challenges that could not be addressed within the short timescale of the project. We conclude that PAR was a suitable mechanism for supporting self-organization and co-learning processes among smallholder farmers and their service providers, enabling them to use ISFM technologies and strengthen their local institutions around natural resource management. This revealed the scope for building adaptive capacity of these communities against climate change and variability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The large diversity of farms and farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa calls for agricultural improvement options that are adapted to the context in which smallholder farmers operate. The socio-ecological niche concept incorporates the agro-ecological, socio-cultural, economic and institutional dimensions and the multiple levels of this context in order to identify which options fit best. In this paper, we illustrate how farming systems analysis, following the DEED cycle of Describe, Explain, Explore and Design, and embedding co-learning amongst researchers, farmers and other stakeholders, helps to operationalize the socio-ecological niche concept. Examples illustrate how farm typologies, detailed farm characterization and on-farm experimental work, in combination with modelling and participatory approaches inform the matching of options to the context at regional, village, farm and field level. Recommendation domains at these gradually finer levels form the basis for gradually more detailed baskets of options from which farmers and other stakeholders may choose, test and adjust to their specific needs. Tailored options identified through the DEED cycle proof to be more relevant, feasible and performant as compared to blanket recommendations in terms of both researcher and farmer-identified criteria. As part of DEED, on-farm experiments are particularly useful in revealing constraints and risks faced by farmers. We show that targeting options to the niches in which they perform best, helps to reduce this risk. Whereas the conclusions of our work about the potential for improving smallholders' livelihoods are often sobering, farming systems analysis allows substantiating the limitations of technological options, thus highlighting the need for enabling policies and institutions that may improve the larger-scale context and increase the uptake potential of options.},

abstract = {Agriculture as a source of food has a substantial spillover that affects the Earth's ecosystems. This results in an 'ecological footprint' of food: negative environmental impacts per capita. The footprint depends on the dietary choice of types and amounts of food, on the non-consumed part of product flows and its fate ('waste' or 'reused'), on transport and processing along the value chain, on the environmental impacts of production per unit area, and on the area needed per unit product. Yield gaps indicate inefficiency in this last aspect: resource-use efficiency gaps for water and nutrients indicate that environmental impacts per unit area are higher than desirable. Ecological intensification aimed at simultaneously closing these two gaps requires process-level understanding and system-level quantification of current efficiency of the use of land and other production factors at multiple scales (field, farm, landscape, regional and global economy). Contrary to common opinion, yield and efficiency gaps are partially independent in the empirical evidence. Synergy in gap closure is possible in many contexts where efforts are made but are not automatic. With Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), enforceable in world trade to control hidden subsidies, there is scope for incremental improvement towards food systems that are efficient at global, yet sustainable at local, scales. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With the Dry Weight Rank (DWR) method of 't Mannetje and Haydock (1963) for botanical analysis in pastures, the dry weight proportions of species are estimated from their first, second and third ranks in dry weight in single quadrats. The yield correction of Haydock and Shaw (1975) is used additionally to solve the problem of the respective under-and overestimations of the dry weight proportions of high and low yielding species when these grow in patches. In this paper the DWR method is evaluated by means of computer simulation. Main element of the simulation model is a computer sampling program with which a fictitious vegetation can be sampled with a circular quadrat. The output shows that the DWR method works well using relatively small sampling quadrats with, on average, only a few plants per quadrat, irrespective of the horizontal vegetation structure. In vegetations where species grow patchwise, satisfactory results are also obtained using large quadrats with much more plants (i.e. tens) per quadrat. The reason is that in these cases also minor species can compete successfully for first, second and third ranks. However, it appeared that only a certain degree of patchiness is necessary, and with the usually applied quadrat sizes up to 25 dm2, probably in most vegetations this condition is fulfilled. Care should be taken in applying the DWR method for estimating species composition in recently sown grasslands where species usually occur more or less at random. In those cases, in principle a very small sampling quadrat (smaller than 1 dm2) could be used. However, this has practical limitations since the quadrat size should not be too small for realistic yield estimations, needed for the Haydock and Shaw yield correction. The simulations revealed that one condition (i.e., that the sampling quadrat should be at least as large that it usually contains three or more species) is not necessary because of the almost always perfect functioning of the correction for missing ranks ('t Mannetje and Haydock, 1963). Generally speaking, a sampling quadrat should be chosen not larger than is strictly necessary from the viewpoint of horizontal vegetation structure and from the viewpoint of realistic yield estimations. Multipliers calculated from simulation data could satisfactory mimic the original multipliers of DWR given by 't Mannetje and Haydock (1963). It is postulated that the DWR method is well suited for studying vegetation changes in old, floristically diverse grasslands with dominant species often in moderate dry weight proportions and species usually growing in patches.},

Field trials were conducted on-farm in Nyanza Province to investigate the effects of phosphate fertilizers and manure on maize yields. The experimental design was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with maize as the test crop. The maize was top dressed with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) fertilizer at a uniform rate of 30 kg N/ha diammonium phosphate (DAP), Minjingu rock phosphate (MRP) and triple super phosphate (TSP) fertilizers were applied at 60 kg/ha P 2 O 5 , farmyard manure (FYM) at 10 t/ha and a non-phosphorus (P) treatment (control) plus lime only. Responses (P ≤ 0.01) from grain yield, total dry matter yield and harvest index to phosphate fertilizers and manure treatments were found. Nutrient uptake and removal by the crop increased (P ≤ 0.01) due to fertilizers and manure application. Phosphate fertilizers and manure application increased (P ≤ 0.01)) available soil P, agronomic phosphorus use efficiency (APUE) and Physiological P use efficiency (PPUE). The results indicate that phosphate fertilizers and manure applications are essential to improve maize yield and nutrient P use efficiency.},

Drawing on best practices currently at work in the private sector and amongst NGO-supported projects, we identify potential investment opportunities and incentives that could promote a culture of record keeping, documentation, data management. Over time, investing in projects that have built-in incentives that solve farmer needs can facilitate record keeping at the farmer level. Putting in place mechanisms such as central registries and platforms for sharing information and coordinating local initiatives can promote the culture of documentation and data management at the local/NGO level. Improvements at the national level may stem from investing more in human and financial resources, capitalizing on public-private partnerships to develop and deploy innovative digital tools for data collection and management, as well as building stronger linkages and tapping into international capacities of agricultural data collection.},

abstract = {In the face of unsustainable land-use changes including intensified agricultural production and land abandonment, agroforestry systems have the potential to support a diversity of social and ecological functions in agricultural landscapes. Mediterranean agroforestry landscapes have been conserved through traditional practices, and new concepts are necessary to assure the viability of these practices. Labels bear the opportunity to indicate sustainable management along the supply chain and, at the same time, generate higher incomes for sustainably producing farms. We have used an expert-based Delphi survey with three iterative surveys to analyse (1) the relevance of different sustainability aspects in agroforestry systems, (2) the suitability of derived indicators for labelling, and (3) the specific potentials and barriers for labelling agroforestry production or ecological UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)—are considered relevant for agroforestry systems. Translating these goals into suitable indicators is the more challenging step, revealing the lack of appropriate data, the complexity of sustainability challenges, and a low willingness for producers to adapt their practices as key limiting factors. The assessment of the labelling schemes indicated coherent responses despite the diverse backgrounds of participants. Alongside eco-labels and social labels, Geographic Indications were suggested as the most suitable options for the agroforestry context, although these have not been invented for reflecting sustainability in the first place. Although experts are highly aware of social-cultural values of agroforestry systems, they see little potential to use those social-cultural aspects for labelling agroforestry products. Initial costs and missing consumer awareness for agroforestry are major reasons for not joining labelling schemes. We discuss the possibility of an agroforestry label and why elements of Geographic Indication labels may fit well for this purpose.},

To increase crop yields and sustain yield gains, recent case studies of technology adoption unanimously recommend the adoption of integrated farm management systems, particularly in SSA. On the other hand, there have been increasing numbers of studies on social network or farmer-to-farmer technology extension. These studies explore more efficient extension systems than traditional public-sector extension approaches.

abstract = {Since the seminal works of Malthus and Boserup, scientists have long debated the impact of population growth and land constraints on the wellbeing of rural people. Today these concerns are particularly relevant to Africa, with its rapid population growth, very small farms, and chronic food insecurity. In this paper we examine adaptation to falling land-labor ratios using a comprehensive theoretical framework in which households faced with binding land constraints can respond in three ways: intensifying agricultural production, diversifying out of agriculture, and reducing fertility rates. Using cross-country data and drawing upon the existing literature, we reach three conclusions. First, population density is associated with reduced fallows and more intensive use of land but not fertilizer use or irrigation, indicating major challenges in achieving sustainable intensification or agricultural productivity growth. Second, there is little evidence of successful non-farm diversification in response to land pressures in Africa from domestic or international income sources. Third, rural Africans in land constrained countries desire smaller families, but have thus far benefited little from family planning policies. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated multi-sectoral approach to sustainably reduce poverty in the region. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Trade-offs among soil C, crop and animal and crop productivity were analysed using the NUANCES-FARMSIM (FArm-scale Resource Management SIMulator) dynamic model. Retention on the soil surface of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100{\%} of the maize stover yield produced per farm, and the use of the remainder as animal feed was quantified over a 12 year period for four farm types in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. Retaining 100{\%} maize residues in the field led to an annual loss of on average 68and 93kg body weight per animal for cattle on farms of the relatively wealthiest farmers (Resource Group, RG1) who had most land and cattle and RG2 respectively), and is therefore unsustainable for livestock production. There was an increase in grain yield of 1.6tfarm-1 and 0.7tfarm-1 for RG1 and RG2 respectively. Farmers without cattle (RG3 and RG4) may have a greater incentive for retaining their crop residues but they have to invest labour to keep the residues during the dry season. However, improved crop productivity for these farmers is limited by lack of access to fertiliser. The current practice of allocating all crop residues to animals results in average gross margin of US{\$}7429 and US{\$}4037 for RG1 and RG2 farmers respectively. Our results showed that from an economic perspective, it is logical that farmers prioritise the sustenance of cattle with crop residues over soil fertility management. We conclude that at current productivity levels, farmers who own cattle have limited scope to allocate crop residues for soil cover as it leads to significant loss in animal production and economic value.},

Many farmers live on the edge of extreme uncertainty, sometimes falling just below, and sometimes rising just above the threshold of survival. Farmers do not know whether rainfall will be good or bad over a season; they do not know the prices they will receive for produce sold; and they do not know whether their crops will be infected by disease. These risks are not under the control of farmers but some farmers have developed ways of coping and managing them.

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) productivity has increased globally as a result of improved genetics and agronomic practices. Plant population and row spacing are two key agronomic factors known to have a strong influence on maize grain yield. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the effects of plant population on maize grain yield, differentiating between rainfall regions, N input, and soil tillage system (conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT]). Data were extracted from 64 peer-reviewed articles reporting on rainfed field trials, representing 13 countries and 127 trial locations. In arid environments, maize grain yield was low (mean maize grain yield = 2448 kg ha−1) across all plant populations with no clear response to plant population. Variation in maize grain yield was high in semiarid environments where the polynomial regression (p {\textless} 0.001, n = 951) had a maximum point at {\~{}}140,000 plants ha−1, which reflected a maize grain yield of 9000 kg ha−1. In subhumid environments, maize grain yield had a positive response to plant population (p {\textless} 0.001). Maize grain yield increased for both CT and NT systems as plant population increased. In high-N-input (r2 = 0.19, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 2 018) production systems, the response of plant population to applied N was weaker than in medium-N-input (r2 = 0.49, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 680) systems. There exists a need for more metadata to be analyzed to provide improved recommendations for optimizing plant populations across different climatic conditions and rainfed maize production systems. Overall, the importance of optimizing plant population to local environmental conditions and farming systems is illustrated.},

These attributes are relevant for the preservation and proper management of land use in the pursuit of a sustainable agriculture. Laboratory and satellite sensors have been applied as a powerful tool for studying so is, but their analysis using these sensors has mainly focused on the visible (Vis), near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, with few studies in the Medium Infrared (MIR). The aim of this study was to identify the spectral pattern of soils with different granulometry (sand and clay) and OC content using laboratory and satellite sensors in the MIR region, specifically in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) range (ASTER, Landsat satellites). The study performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of clay, OC and sand fractions (fine and coarse). The study area is located in the region of Piracicaba, S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil, where collected 150 soil samples (0–20 cm depth). Soil texture was determined by the pipette method and OC via dry combustion. Reflectance and emissivity (Ɛ) spectral data were obtained with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Alpha sensor (Bruker Optics Corporation). An image “ASTER{\_}05” from July 15, 2017 was acquired with values of Ɛ. Samples were separated by textural classes and the spectral behavior in the TIR region was described. The data obtained by the laboratory sensor were resampled to the satellite sensor bands. The behavior between spectra of both sensors was similar and had significant correlation with the studied attributes, mainly sand. For the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, six strategies were used (MIR, MIR{\_}ASTER, ASTER, TIR, TIR Correlation Index (TIR{\_}CID), and MIR Correlation Index (MIR{\_}CID)), which consisted in the use of all sensors bands, or by the selection of bands that presented the most significant correlations with each one of the attributes. Models presented a good performance in the prediction of all attributes using the whole MIR. In the TIR region, the models for total sand content and for fine and coarse fractions were good. Models created with ASTER sensor data were not as promising as those with laboratory ones. The use of specific bands was useful in estimating some attributes in the MIR and TIR, improving the predictive performance and validation of models. Therefore, the discrimination of soil attributes with satellite sensors can be improved with the identification of specific bands, as observed in the results with laboratory sensors.},

New measures of agro-ecological potential and urban gravity are developed to analyze their impact on population density and market access. The descriptive and regression analyses show that the patterns of intensification across countries are only partially consistent with the BR predictions. Fallow areas have disappeared, but cropping intensities remain very low. The use of organic and chemical fertilizers is too low to maintain soil fertility. Investments in irrigation are inadequate. In light of the promising outcomes suggested by the Boserup-Ruthenberg framework, the process of intensification across these countries appears to have been weak.},

While more advanced technologies are available, to reach smallholder farmers simple technologies such as mobile SMS are needed. The main objective of this study was to explore the acceptance of mobile SMS technology by smallholder farmers to provide farm related information. A second objective was to assess the role of farmer's characteristics (i.e., age and experience) in predicting farmers' intentions to adopt mobile SMS. This study extended the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model with constructs from trust, personal innovativeness in information technology and mastery-approach goals. The sample (N = 220) consisted of a group of smallholder farmers from three Ethiopian regions involved in a mobile SMS experiment and a control group. Structural equation modelling showed that intentions to adopt mobile SMS technology for agricultural data provision were predicted by the perceived usefulness of the technology (performance expectancy), the effort needed to use the technology (effort expectancy), the cost of using the technology (price value) and the trustworthiness of the organising body (trust; e.g., organisations behind the citizen science initiative). Multi-group analysis using farmer's age and experience as moderator variables further revealed that performance expectancy was important for younger farmers, whereas price value was important for farmers who did not participate in a mobile SMS experiment. This study generates useful information and implications for citizen science practitioners, policy makers and mobile application developers by identifying the driving factors for farmers to adopt mobile SMS for agricultural data collection.},

abstract = {Functional ecology provides a framework that can link vegetation characteristics of various land uses with ecosystem function. However, this application has been mostly limited to [semi-]natural systems and small spatial scales. Here, we apply functional ecology to five agricultural landscapes in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, and ask to what extent vegetation characteristics contribute to soil functions that are key to farmers' livelihoods. We used the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF), a multi-scale assessment of land health. Each LDSF site is a 10 × 10 km landscape in which vegetation cover and erosion prevalence were measured, a tree inventory was carried out, and topsoil (0–20 cm) samples were collected for organic carbon (SOC) analysis in approximately 160 × 1,000 m2 plots. Land degradation is a recurring phenomenon across the five landscapes, indicated by high erosion prevalence (67{\%}–99{\%} of the plots were severely eroded). We used mixed models to assess if vegetation cover, above-ground woody biomass and the functional properties of woody vegetation (weighted-mean trait values, functional diversity [FD]) explain variation in SOC and erosion prevalence. We found that the vegetation cover and above-ground biomass had strong positive effects on soil health by increasing SOC and reducing soil erosion. After controlling for cover and biomass, we found additional marginal effects of functional properties where FD was positively associated with SOC and the abundance of invasive species was associated with higher soil erosion. Synthesis and applications. This work illustrates how functional ecology can provide much-needed evidence for designing strategies to restore degraded agricultural land and the ecosystem services on which farmers depend. We show that to ensure soil health, it is vital to avoid exposed soil, maintain or promote tree cover, while ensuring functional diversity of tree species, and to eradicate invasive species.},

abstract = {Functional trait-based ecological research has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of natural plant community dynamics. However, to date, principles of functional trait ecology have not been widely applied to agricultural research and management. Here, we discuss why and how a functional trait approach - distinct from a traditional agronomic trait approach that focuses strictly on crop yield components - can provide a valuable framework for agricultural research. We illustrate these points with an emphasis on commodity crops. The literature suggests a key role for functional trait-based research in understanding the causes and consequences of changes in agroecosystem structure and function. This includes novel approaches to understanding crop breeding and productivity, agroecosystem dynamics and non-crop biodiversity maintenance, the contributions of agroecosystems to global net primary productivity and other biogeochemical cycles, and agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We propose that a key step in advancing trait-based agricultural research is the consolidation of functional trait data for the world's most common crop and fodder species, the main commodities on ∼1{\textperiodcentered}2 billion ha of land. Using Coffea arabica as an example, we show there is strong potential to populate a comprehensive data base of crop functional trait data. For C. arabica, there exist hundreds of observations for ecologically important 'leaf economics' and 'root economics' traits, either in smaller data bases or peer-reviewed studies, but these have not been consolidated. A similar opportunity for functional trait data consolidation exists for many of the world's most common crops. Synthesis and applications. A unified functional trait data base for just 65 of the world's most common agricultural crops can be used to provide baseline evaluations of the functional diversity across croplands covering ∼8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} of the Earth's land surface. This functional trait data, and other trait-based research, could further be used to evaluate how changes in interspecific and intraspecific crop diversity are mechanistically linked with alterations in agroecosystem function. Ultimately, trait-based research that examines the causes and consequences of agricultural homogenization may contribute to more ecologically informed management of agricultural diversity, from genetic through to global scales.

Based on farm household and Participatory Rural Appraisal data collected from districts in various agroecological zones in Kenya, this paper examines farmers' perceptions of climate change, ongoing adaptation measures, and factors influencing farmers' decisions to adapt. The results show that households face considerable challenges in adapting to climate change. While many households have made small adjustments to their farming practices in response to climate change (in particular, changing planting decisions), few households are able to make more costly investments, for example in agroforestry or irrigation, although there is a desire to invest in such measures. This emphasizes the need for greater investments in rural and agricultural development to support the ability of households to make strategic, long-term decisions that affect their future well-being. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The . Abstract Soil acidity is widespread globally , accounting for about 40{\%} of total arable soils . In the tropics , substantial weathering of soils over millennia has resulted in the leaching of crop nutrient bases (mainly K , Mg and Ca) followed by their replacement by H , Al , Mn cations which contribute to acid related stresses on crop production . The practice of liming acid soils is not common in Sub - Saharan Africa , perhaps as a result of limited knowledge on lime effectiveness , availability and high hauling costs of liming materials . A field study in western Kenya in 2005 - 2006 showed significant effects (p{\textless}0 . 05) of lime at 2 t ha - 1 combined with phosphorus at 26 kg P ha - 1 and nitrogen at 75 kg N ha - 1 . The soil pH was raised to the range of 5 . 8 to 6 . 5 (by lime) , while available phosphorus increased above 10 mg P ha - 1 (the critical level) . This input combination also resulted in significant maize yield increases to 6 t ha - 1 , compared to the small scale farmers ' yield of 0 . 5 t ha - 1 . In addition to N and P inputs , liming is a practice with potential to improve crop yields on acid soils that are predominant in western Kenya .},

abstract = {This paper discusses the concept of Farmer Field School and its role in a multidisciplinary research agenda for sustainable agriculture in Africa. The FFS as a group learning approach builds knowledge and capacity among farmers to enable them diagnose their problems, identify solutions and develop plans and implement them with or without support from outside. The paper suggests that a multidisciplinary research agenda will not only aim at technology development but will also seek ways of stakeholder participation in technology development, validation and dissemination. It concludes that this approach will not only increase agricultural productivity; but it will also lead to sustainable agriculture in Africa.},

@article{Sanchez2010,
abstract = {The benefits provided by underutilised fruit tree species such as baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in combating increasing malnutrition and poverty become more apparent as awareness grows regarding concerns of climate change and food security. Due to its multiple uses, its high nutritional and medicinal value, drought tolerance and relatively easy cultivation, baobab has been identified as one of the most important edible forest trees to be conserved, domesticated and valued in Africa. In order to contribute towards the cultivation of the species, suitability of sites in Africa and worldwide was evaluated for potential cultivation using species' locality data and spatial environmental data in MAXENT modelling framework. A total of 450 geo-referenced records of the baobab tree were assembled from herbarium records, commercial firm's databases and fieldwork for modelling site suitability for global cultivation of the baobab tree. Climatic and topographic data were acquired from the Worldclim data while soil data was obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database. MAXENT was found to be a successful modelling method for studying cultivation potential. The main variables that contributed towards predicting baobab's global cultivation potential were annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. Results suggest that baobab tree could be widely cultivated in most countries in southern Africa and in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan. Angola and Somalia were found to be highly suitable for cultivating baobab in Africa. Model suggests, India, where the baobab tree already exists and is used, to be the most suitable country for baobab cultivation outside Africa. North-west Australia, Madagascar, north-east Brazil and Mexico resulted to be other suitable places for cultivating the tree species. Although it is recommended model results be validated with in situ seedling experiments, there seems to be a great potential for the cultivation of this species globally. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
