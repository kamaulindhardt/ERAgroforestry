  The purpose of this website is to tell a story - the story of Evidence for Resilient Agriculture (ERA) through data analysis and visualisation. One of the objectives is to demonstrate how data from ERA can be analysed though inherent package functions (in ERAg) as well as with machine learning using the tidymodels meta-package framework.

# Who is this website for

The website has been designed in a user-friendly way. What user? - you may ask. One that has at leas a basic understanding or interest in agricultural and/or environmental data (analysis). It is the intention that the site will facilitate understanding and usage of ERA data, but most importantly to tell the story of the data in ERA. 

# How to use this website

This website describes the project and meta-database 'Evidence for Resilient Agriculture' (ERA), through working with it's data found in the ERAg package version xx.xx.xx. The website is divided in four parts: Part 1: Introduction and description, Part 2: Analysing ERA agroforestry data with ERAAnalyze, Part 3: Analysing ERA agroforestry data with the tidymodels machine learning meta-package, and finally a bonus section called Part 4: Analysing the same ERA agroforestry data with the tidymodels workflowsets package - a new package designed to fast and efficiently compare models and model pre-processing steps. If you are new to ERA and tidymodels please start at the introduction (Part 1), but feel free to jump to other parts if needed.  


# Who created this website

This website has been designed and developed by Kamau Lindhardt. I am passionate about resilient and sustainable agriculture and land-use systems by levering on the potentials of data -and geospatial sciences and applied agroecological knowledge for people and planet. All ERA data and content provided through the ERAg package is made possible by Todd Rosenstock, Peter Steward, and the rest of the ERA team who have worked for years to gather and synthesize the large amounts of data that make up the ERA meta-database.

# Why

At the end of my internship at the ERA project hosted by The World Agroforestry Centre, I found it difficult to find a proper way of consolidating months of work on analysing agroforestry data from ERA, into a tangible and meaningful "product"
